All very well for Sean to tell you he was in despair about Trump but what did he tell his viewers?\" Murdoch said in an email to Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott on Jan. 21, 2021, in an apparent reference to Fox News hosts Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham. The exchange came 15 days after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.\nFox News host Tucker Carlson, who went on to push false claims about the 2020 election, ripped then-President Donald Trump in January 2021 text messages, according to the filings. \"I hate him passionately,\" Carlson wrote. \"There isn't really an upside to Trump.\"\nA Delaware judge ordered the documents unsealed. While portions of the depositions and evidence have been released in recent weeks, Tuesday's filings are the most extensive revelations regarding private communications at Fox Corp. and Fox News.\nDominion has argued in its suit that Fox and its ring-wing cable TV channels and talent falsely claimed that its voting machines rigged the results of the 2020 election.\nFox News on Tuesday said the documents it filed showed \"Dominion has been caught red handed using more distortions and misinformation in their PR campaign to smear FOX News and trample on free speech and freedom of the press. We already know they will say and do anything to try to win this case, but to twist and even misattribute quotes to the highest levels of our company is truly beyond the pale.\"\nThe company points to Fox Corp. CEO Lachlan Murdoch's testimony about being \"kept awake at night\" regarding ratings and competition following the 2020 election. Dominion has said and pointed to text messages between talent regarding fears about audience following Fox's election night call of Arizona for Joe Biden. Lachlan Murdoch said in general ratings were something that have kept him up at night.\n\"You know, you get a few gray hairs from being awake at – sports ratings or news ratings or entertainment ratings are probably the worst so,\" Lachlan Murdoch said, according to court papers.\nA spokesperson for Dominion said Thursday: \"The emails, texts, and deposition testimony speak for themselves. We welcome all scrutiny of our evidence because it all leads to the same place — Fox knowingly spread lies causing enormous damage to an American company.\"\nTrump has repeatedly spread false claims that the 2020 election between him and now-President Joe Biden was rigged. He attempted to pressure a top official in Georgia to \"find\" votes for him have become the subject of a criminal probe in the state, which Trump lost to Joe Biden.\nIn an exchange between host Maria Bartiromo and former top Trump advisor Steve Bannon, Bartiromo said she was \"so depressed.\"\n\"I want to see massive fraud exposed Will he be able to turn this around. I told my team we are not allowed to say [president] elect at [all]. Not in scripts or banners on air. Until this moves through the courts,\" Bartiromo said in a text message exchange. Bannon replied, \"71 million voters will never accept Biden This process is to destroy is presidency before it even starts; IF it even starts.\"\nFox News has consistently denied that it knowingly made false claims about the election. It has alleged Dominion is \"cherry picking\" quotes from depositions and documents gathered through discovery.\nFox Corp. has also said in court papers that the past year of discovery has shown the media company played \"no role in the creation and publication of the challenged statements – all of which aired on either Fox Business Network or Fox News Channel.\"\nAlso Tuesday, attorneys for Dominion and Fox met before a Delaware judge to discuss next steps leading into the scheduled trial that is to begin in mid-April. Before then, Dominion and Fox will meet again in Delaware court on March 21 regarding their motions for summary judgement.\nThe exhibits filed to a Delaware court on Tuesday comes after weeks of court filings that have unveiled parts of the gathered evidence and\n, other top Fox Corp. brass,\n.\nIn the filings,\n, Murdoch acknowledged that some of Fox's top TV anchors parroted false claims in the months following the 2020 presidential election, and that some even endorsed the claims.\n\"Some of our commentators were endorsing it,\" Murdoch said in his response during the deposition. \"They endorsed.\"\nCourt papers also show Murdoch and his son, Fox Corp. CEO Lachlan Murdoch, were close to Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott during the time regarding coverage on the network. Depositions and evidence such as text messages show personalities like Carlson, Hannity and Ingraham\nbeing made on air.\nThe case is being closely watched by First Amendment watchdogs. Libel lawsuits are typically focused on one falsehood, but in this case Dominion cites a long list of examples of Fox's cable channels and its hosts making false claims even after they were proven to be untrue. Media companies are often broadly protected by the First Amendment.\nThe lawsuit has also provided a window into what happens behind the scenes at Fox News, as well as other events tied to the 2020 election fraud claims that were covered on Fox's networks.\nFor instance, court filings show that\nTrump's attempt to appear on the network's air on the evening of Jan. 6, 2021, after a violent mob of Trump supporters attacked the Capitol in a bid to prevent Congress from confirming Biden's victory.\nThat evening, top Fox host Tucker Carlson texted his producer, calling Trump \"a demonic force.\"\nCourt papers also show that Murdoch also said it was \"wrong\" for Carlson to host MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, an\ntied to the election, weeks after Jan. 6.\nCarlson, along with top anchors including Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, had expressed disbelief in what Sidney Powell, a pro-Trump attorney who had aggressively promoted claims of election fraud, had said at the time, too.\nOn Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York,\nfor airing Jan. 6 footage on Monday in a way that portrayed it as a peaceful visit to the U.S. Capitol. Schumer also criticized House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., for giving Carlson and Fox News exclusive access to 44,000 hours of Capitol security footage.\nMeanwhile, Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.,\nto Murdoch and Fox News leadership, calling on them \"to stop spreading false election narratives and admit on the air that they were wrong to engage in such negligent behavior.\" The letter was released in the days after further revelations in the case."},

Netflix\npassword-sharing protocols for users in Canada, New Zealand, Portugal and Spain that call for users to set a \"primary location\" for their Netflix accounts — and that add additional monthly fees for out-of-household \"sub accounts.\"\nWhile Netflix hasn't said whether the U.S. plan will ultimately resemble these earlier changes, some worry that a crackdown on password sharing could shake up streaming for college students who've just left home, as well as burden lower-income students and their families.\nSam Figiel, a sophomore at Mercer University in Georgia, said access to Netflix is required for many of his peers' classes. Figiel, who uses his mother's account, said nearly everyone he knows at school watches Netflix, although he and some friends might move away from the platform if password sharing ends.\n\"Without Netflix, I would have to find a way to compensate for classes, but the only other way I could compensate would be going to another streaming platform,\" Figiel said. \"My parents are paying for three kids in college. They have all their own expenses. They pay for all of our car payments, all of our phone bills, so they don't really have a lot of extra money to spend.\"\nNetflix has long touted how it puts subscribers first. Yet the gradual password-sharing changes have created uncertainty for college students who might not have, or want to spend, disposable income for their own subscriptions.\nNetflix spokesperson Kumiko Hidaka directed CNBC to the company's earlier announcements for information on its previous steps, but declined to comment further. Chengyi Long, the company's director of product innovation, said in February that\nwere sharing accounts, amounting to about 43% of the company's\npaid global memberships, as of this month.\nAccording to a\n, 40% of U.S. households share or use shared passwords, a rise from 27% in 2019. People in the 18-to-34 age group, which accounts for 30% of all Netflix users, are more likely to exchange passwords than older viewers. Netflix reported 74.3 million paid streaming subscribers across the U.S. and Canada in its fourth quarter.\nVrisha Sookraj, a junior at the University of Maryland who watches Netflix from her parents' account, said it's the go-to streaming platform for nearly everyone she knows. But she's worried the prospective policies could push some younger consumers away.\nSookraj suggested that a student plan, similar to cheaper subscription plans offered by\n, Hulu and\nPrime, could allow for more flexibility while accommodating different income levels. Still, she's on the fence about whether she would pay the monthly fee herself.\n\"Maybe it's not that expensive, but at the end of the day, saving money is saving money,\" Sookraj said.\nNetflix executives have acknowledged that while the change should help the company's financial results, it might not be so popular with users. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said at a December conference that the paid-sharing model \"feels a lot like the way you'd manage a price increase,\" adding that it will be \"really revenue positive\" and \"market expanding.\"\nBut, he added: \"Make no mistake, I don't think consumers are going to love it right out of the gate.\"\nNetflix last month said users in Canada, New Zealand, Portugal and Spain can create up to two \"sub accounts\" for users not living in the primary location for a monthly fee per extra user: CA$7.99 in Canada, NZ$7.99 in New Zealand, 3.99 euros in Portugal and 5.99 euros in Spain.\nThe company hasn't shared what a U.S. pricing model would look like — if it follows that example.\nIn countries listed above, users can also ask non-household members to establish their own individual accounts by transferring their profiles to a new account, which will maintain personalized recommendations and viewing history from the original account.\nThe guidelines came after a trial period in Chile, Peru and Costa Rica that began in May.\nThe company has worked to support \"customer choice and frankly a long history of customer centricity,\" Netflix executive Greg Peters, who became co-CEO in January, said during an earnings call last October.\nStill, he said, the company needs to balance those goals with the need to \"get paid.\"\nFor Netflix, the calculus pits subscriber growth against monthly fees — and not for the first time. In November, Netflix\ndubbed \"Basic With Ads\" that costs $6.99 per month — a bid to bring in more viewers at a lower price point.\nSome Wall Street analysts believe there could be a hiccup immediately after a U.S. password crackdown, resulting in higher churn in the second quarter, followed by possible revenue growth.\nWells Fargo analysts think password sharing could be a bigger near-term catalyst for revenue than the introduction of the ad-supported tier.\nIn a January note, Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen speculated that the average revenue per user could rise if enough free users get pushed off the platform and then rejoin as paid subscribers or are added as sub accounts. He told CNBC this week that he expects many users who drop the service to come back pretty quickly given the scale of Netflix's content base, although he anticipates some initial churn for the next quarter.\n\"There are a lot, lot, lot of U.S. users that are not paying for it, and so I think they're very sensitive to the backlash that they're going to get when they institute this,\" Nollen said. \"It'll take some time to get to the point they really know what they're doing and they really can start to make money out of it.\"\nIf Netflix charges extra for sub accounts in the U.S., these added costs may prove challenging for Thuan Tran, a senior at Duke University from Vietnam who shares his own account with his sister and partner. While he acknowledged that many Duke students have the financial means to support added costs, he said significant changes to the subscription structure would make him think twice.\n\"When your whole shtick is that you can share an account with people that you love in different places ... and then now you reverse that and then go and charge people more if they want more profiles or screens, then that's kind of going against a lot of the things that made your site attractive to a lot of viewers,\" Tran said.\nEven if the cost of a subscription could rise for borrowers, some college students think Netflix is too important to give up.\nElizabeth Danaher, a sophomore at the University of Missouri-Columbia studying communications and film, said Netflix has enabled her to watch films with her family in Illinois while she's away at school, especially with her father, who edited \"A League of Their Own\" and \"Home Alone 2.\" She said it would \"definitely hurt\" if the cost structure prohibits her from accessing Netflix — which she considers a vital \"source of information\" — though she said she and many of her peers would likely shell out a few dollars a month.\n\"I think at the end of the day, Netflix is probably a necessity to me,\" Danaher said.\nAccording to a study from Leichtman Research Group that has yet to be released, roughly 66% of households nationwide have Netflix. About 14% of all households that have Netflix borrow it from someone else and do not pay, according to the online survey of 3,500 adults across the U.S. That jumps to 21% for consumers aged 18 to 34.\n\"What sharing did was help them grow the company, but now what it's doing, it's limiting their potential growth of subscribers,\" President and Principal Analyst Bruce Leichtman said, adding that Netflix lost nearly a million subscribers last year in the U.S. and Canada.\nLeichtman estimates sub accounts could cost an extra $3 each and says, according to survey data, about half of both sharers and borrowers say they would pay a fee at that rate. About 10% in both categories said they would pay the extra charge but would also look to downgrade their account.\nOf those survey respondents who share their login credentials, about a quarter say they would drop Netflix after a policy change that would cost them additional monthly fees per sub account, compared with a third of borrowers. Though Leichtman said it's unlikely to play out to that degree as people settle into paying a few extra dollars per month under new policies.\nAravind Kalathil, a senior at the University of Missouri-Columbia, said he uses a stranger's Netflix account that's been logged in on his apartment's smart TV. Kalathil and his roommates don't know who owns and pays for the account, and are prepared to have their access cut off without warning should password restrictions go into effect.\n\"In the end for us, it probably will not have the biggest effect because our families all have Netflix accounts and we will make it work, but it just adds extra hassle and annoyance to something that in the end is kind of expendable with the amount of streaming services out there,\" Kalathil said."},

A spokesperson noted Colorado currently has a statute prohibiting wagers on events with fixed or predicted outcomes, including the Academy Awards.\nIf WWE succeeds in its bid to legalize gambling on matches, it could open the door for legalized betting on other guarded, secret scripted events, such as future character deaths in TV series.\nAllowing gambling on certain WWE matches would alter how matches are produced – and how storylines are created. In discussions about how gambling on wrestling could work, WWE executives have proposed that scripted results of matches be locked in months ahead of time, according to people familiar with the matter. The wrestlers themselves wouldn't know whether they were winning or losing until shortly before a match takes place, said the people.\nFor example, the WWE could lock the results of Wrestlemania's main event months ahead of time, based on a scripted storyline that hinged to the winner of January's Royal Rumble. Betting on the match could then take place between the end of the Royal Rumble and up to days or even hours before Wrestlemania, when the wrestlers and others in the show's production would learn the results.\nThe introduction of legalized gambling could give WWE an increased appeal to a new set of fans while significantly altering creative storylines. Paul Levesque, whose wrestling name is Triple H, took over as head of WWE's creative operations from Vince McMahon in July. McMahon stepped down as WWE chairman and CEO last year\nbut\nas executive chairman to prepare the company for a sale process.\nWWE is set to meet with potential buyers for the company next month in preparation for first-round bids, two of the people said. There's no assurance a transaction will take place."},

Andy Barr, a Kentucky Republican and chair of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Monetary Policy, said in opening remarks. \"This has led to the CFPB becoming the most unchecked, unaccountable agency in the whole federal government.\"\nGOP lawmakers in the hearing\ncriticized the Biden administration's push to eradicate \"junk fees,\" largely regulated by the CFPB. Such fees constitute surcharges that companies levy for consumer goods and services.\nOn Wednesday, the agency\nof illegal junk fees encompassing deposit accounts; auto and mortgage loan servicing; and payday and title lending.\nSubcommittee member Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-Mo., said Chopra has used junk fees as an excuse to expand his authority.\n\"So, the fact that we now call them junk fees doesn't mean it's real,\" Luetkemeyer said after witness Jessica L. Thompson, an attorney at the conservative-leaning Pacific Legal Foundation, agreed that the term does not exist as in the financial lexicon.\n\"Because there is no such word out there. There is no authority. So, I think we as a group need to be pushing back,\" he said.\nThe murky definition for junk fees leaves financial institutions \"with no road map as to how to follow that,\" said William Himpler, president and CEO of the American Financial Services Association, a trade group for consumer credit companies.\nAnother witness accused the CFPB of making arbitrary decisions about what qualifies as a junk fee. The CFPB's working definition of junk fees is \"any fee they don't like,\" argued Devin Watkins, an attorney at the conservative-leaning Competitive Enterprise Institute.\n\"When the definition under how they're acting is so broad like that, it raises real non-delegation concerns that could undermine their authority to enact any of these,\" Watkins said.\nAt least one witness defended the CFPB's authority to combat excessive surcharges. Keith Ellison, Minnesota's Democratic attorney general and a former member of the House Financial Services Committee, has defended the agency's oversight of predatory lending services and fraudulent actors. He has said the CFPB can regulate hidden surcharges consumers do not know about.\n\"Maybe certain firms don't know what junk fees are but consumers know,\" said Ellison, who served in Congress when the agency was created. \"[Companies] don't disclose [the fees]. They didn't tell you about it. They didn't know you had a reason to anticipate it. It's a fee that they tack on because they have the market power to impose that fee.\"\n\"It is absolutely appropriate for the CFPB to regulate this,\" Ellison added. \"I can tell you, attorneys general, both Democrat and Republican, do it every day. And it is part of the way that we create confidence, faith and create the ability for consumers to have a shot at prosperity.\"\nThe CFPB was created as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law by former President Barack Obama in 2010. The law overhauled the financial regulatory system after the 2008 Great Recession.\nIn 2021, President Joe Biden chose Chopra to serve as the bureau's director. Chopra was previously appointed to serve on the Federal Trade Commission by former President Donald Trump.\nRepublican lawmakers have criticized the agency's funding mechanism, which bypasses the annual appropriations process, and the lack of an executive board or independent inspection mechanism. Proposed legislation the subcommittee is set to consider includes oversight of existing guidance, rules and regulations; changing the CFPB's funding source to ensure Congress has to approve it; establishment of an Office of Inspector General for the CFPB; and a requirement for the agency to monetarily reward whistleblowers.\nBut some Democrats have argued Republicans have wanted to fight the CFPB's oversight of banks and other financial institutions since the agency was formed.\n\"Many in the Republican Party have fought against the CFPB since its inception, repeatedly seeking ways to delegitimize, defund, or most recently, to abolish the agency entirely,\" said Rep. Barry Loudermilk, D-Ga., the subcommittee vice chair.\nOther Democratic lawmakers pushed back against their GOP counterparts on Thursday with a biting statement released during the hearing.\n\"Make no mistake. This is about whose side you're on: workers and consumers or big corporations and Wall Street,\" said Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, ranking member of House Financial Services Committee and Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, chair of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Waters also questioned Ellison during the subcommittee hearing.\n\"This is not reform for the benefit of consumers, it is another page pulled from the same Republican playbook designed to destroy the CFPB and its work to empower consumers. The CFPB has made major progress in supporting consumers, combatting discrimination and junk fees, holding large financial institutions accountable for repeatedly harming consumers, and so much more,\" the lawmakers said.\n\"As chair of the Senate Banking and Housing Committee and Ranking Member of the House Financial Services Committee, we will continue to work with our colleagues to stop any anti-consumer bill and protect the CFPB so that consumers can continue to have an agency solely dedicated to protecting their hard-earned money,\" the lawmakers added."},

Facing a Republican-controlled House, it's unlikely many of the proposals will be passed in their current form. The president submits his budget to Congress outlining the administration's priorities for the upcoming year, but ultimately Congress decides where the funds are allocated.\nWhite House Office of Management and Budget director Shalanda Young told reporters the administration is able to cut deficit spending \"by asking the wealthy and big corporations to begin to pay their fair share and by cutting wasteful spending on Big Pharma, Big Oil and other special interests.\"\n\"It does this in part by reforming our tax code to reward work, not wealth, including by ensuring that no billionaire pays a lower tax rate than a teacher or firefighter and by quadrupling the tax rate on corporate stock buybacks,\" Young said. \"That's a very clear contrast with congressional Republicans.\"\nThe Stock Buybacks Tax builds upon a measure Biden signed into law last year reducing the differential treatment in the code between buybacks and dividends. The goal is to encourage business to invest in growth rather than spending on stock buybacks. Under the budget proposal, the tax would quadruple from 1% to 4%. A Data for Progress poll from February found 58% of Americans support increasing the stock-buyback tax.\nBiden's fiscal year 2024 budget gets some help from the slowing Covid-19 pandemic, which the White House noted needs less emergency aid as the outbreak enters a new phase thanks to widespread vaccinations. The president's spending priorities include increasing funding for early childhood education and child care, expanding the $35 cap on insulin prices to all Americans and expanding free community college. These proposals are all part of his push to give American families \"a little more breathing room.\" The 2024 fiscal year begins Oct. 1 and runs through Sept. 30, 2024.\nCecilia Rouse, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, explained how the administration believes the social programs outlined in the White House budget will actually boost the economy.\n\"Policies such as paid leave and child care will bring more workers into the labor force and improve productivity,\" Rouse said. \"Investments in early education, mental health and community college not only expand our economy's productive capacity but pay dividends for generations to come.\"\nIn addition to social spending, the budget includes robust defense funding. At more than $835 billion, the defense budget would be among the largest peacetime expenditures in U.S. history.\nFor weeks the president has urged House Republicans to present their own budget proposals instead of just criticizing his plan. House Republicans have promised to propose a balanced budget and have scoffed when the White House pointed to GOP proposals to make cuts to programs like Social Security and Medicare. House Budget Committee Chair Jodey Arrington told CNN on Wednesday the Republican budget should be ready by the second week in May.\nSpeaking in Philadelphia, Pa. on Thursday, Biden said he and House Speaker\n, who the president noted is \"a very conservative guy\" with \"a very conservative group\" of lawmakers, agreed early on to meet after they both introduce their budgets.\n\"We'll sit down and we'll go line by line, and we'll go through it and see what we can agree on, what we disagree on, and then fight it out in the Congress,\" Biden recounted telling McCarthy. \"I'm ready to meet with the Speaker anytime, tomorrow if he has his budget. Lay it down, show me what you want to do, I'll show what I want to do. We can see what we can agree on, see what we don't agree on and we vote on it.\"\nThe White House, in its budget proposal, includes an entire section dedicated to shoring up Social Security and Medicare, funded by the minimum 25% wealth tax on households with a net worth of $100 million or more. The proposed budget would extend \"the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund by at least 25 years\" without removing benefits or raising costs. It also provides a $1.4 billion increase in funding for Social Security to improve services.\n\"Benefit cuts are not on the table,\" Young said.\nLooming over the budget release is the unresolved standoff over whether to lift the debt ceiling. The White House has maintained it will not negotiate over the debt limit, arguing Congress should act to raise it as it has done numerous times over past decades. House Republicans, led by Speaker\n, have tried to tie the debt ceiling to future spending, saying they will not budge without promises to cut expenses. The debt ceiling, however, pertains to existing spending. To date, House Republicans have been murky on what expenses they would like to see cut.\n\"MAGA Republicans in Congress have tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid — we're not going to let them folks,\" Biden said. \"My budget makes robust investments on military defense, let's see what the MAGA Republicans propose and let's be clear where I stand: I will not allow cuts to the needs of the intelligence community or military that help keep us safe.\"\nRouse touted the administration's economic track record, noting that unemployment has fallen somewhat inexplicably under Biden's watch — even as the pace of inflation has slowed. She said most economists couldn't have predicted the jobs market would rebound as strongly as it has since he took office.\n\"I think if you told most conventional macroeconomists last June that we were about to get seven straight months of declining annual CPI inflation, they would have told us that the unemployment rate would rise over that time, but instead the unemployment rate in January was 3.4%, or 0.2 percentage points lower than it was,\" Rouse said, noting that February's unemployment rate will be released Friday. \"The economy looks healthier today than it did in other ways, too.\"\nRouse expanded on that, in an attempt to ease recession concerns by pointing to economic gains already seen under the administration's watch.\n\"The strength of our recovery has put us on solid ground to weather economic shocks,\" Rouse said. \"Americans are back to work and the economy is stronger than anyone, including the federal government and private forecasters, imagined it would be when President Biden took office.\""},

It also tried billing Medicare more than $500,000 for various medical equipment — such as braces, orthotics and wheelchairs — for patients who didn't exist.\nDuring a routine check by HHS' Office of Inspector General, which investigates Medicare and Medicaid fraud, special agents in Florida noticed that a local company had recently changed owners and had another address in their building. But that location didn't have any actual employees. It was no more than a mail drop, a physical location of a shell corporation designed to make it look legitimate on paper, said  Omar Pérez Aybar, special agent in charge for Florida.\nA deeper look at the company's billing practices revealed what appeared to be Medicare fraud, Pérez Aybar said.\nWhen agents grilled the new owner, he admitted his name was used on corporate business records to conceal the identity of the real owners. Because the investigation is still ongoing and no arrests have been made, agents provided few details identifying the operation. But Pérez Aybar said it was shuttered last year before Medicare lost any money.\nThat's just one of thousands of examples of how Medicare fraud is flourishing — not only in south Florida, but across the country.\nTaxpayers are losing more than $100 billion a year to Medicare and Medicaid fraud, according to estimates from the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association.\n\"That's probably a conservative number,\" Pérez Aybar said. \"When we think about all lines of business in Medicare and Medicaid, that's probably a drop in the bucket.\"\nThe fraud runs the gamut: billing for unapproved Covid tests, phony billing for wheelchairs, braces and other medical equipment, genetic testing fraud, home health-care billing and a host of other schemes. Investigators say fraudsters have gotten more brazen in recent years — as Washington swiftly doled out trillions of dollars in Covid-19 relief funds and other aid in response to the pandemic.\nThe proliferation of crime has taxed the inspector general, which has just 450 agents around the country. The amount at stake is staggering: Medicare spends about $901 billion a year on its 65 million beneficiaries, while Medicaid spends $734 billion providing medical coverage to more than 85 million poor and disabled Americans every year, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which falls under HHS. The inspector general describes the fraud as prevalent and inventive, routinely ensnaring full-time criminals as well as legitimate doctors and health-care professionals gone bad, according to its annual reports.\n\"It's just so easy. It's unbelievable,\" said one Miami man, who admitted that he used to make a living by stealing from Medicare.\n\"You'll be surprised. For money, they'll do anything,\" he said, asking not to be identified for fear of retribution by people he worked with in the criminal underworld. \"It's always been like that. And people keep on — they get caught, they get out, and they'll do it all over again.\"\nHe was arrested and charged with running an illegal pill business, according to agents who worked his case. The scheme involved multiple players who were all on the take and got a cut of the windfall from defrauding Medicare, the special agents said.\nDescribing the scheme, the fraudster said he recruited patients to get a prescription from a doctor that was then filled at a pharmacy and paid for by Medicare. He would then remove the label and \"wash\" the bottle to make it look new before reselling the pills to a wholesaler, which would sell them back to that pharmacy or another one that was in on the deal, he said. The same pills could be sold and resold multiple times with different phony patients, billing Medicare each time.\nIt was a lucrative scheme.\n\"I was low-profile, nobody knew about me. I had everything. I had houses, I had cars, I had watches,\" he said, adding that he routinely raked in millions from health-care fraud for more than a decade.\nEventually, though, someone who knew him was caught and turned him over to law enforcement in exchange for more lenient treatment, he said. He ended up pleading guilty to health care-related fraud and served three years in prison.\nEven when the fraudsters get caught — the reward may outweigh the risk.\n\"I don't think the government can keep up,\" he said. \"People keep on. They're not gonna stop.\"\nPérez Aybar said the inspector general is understaffed to handle the never-ending volume of cases. In fiscal year 2021, about 2 cents of every $100 spent by HHS went to oversight and enforcement, according to figures compiled by the inspector general's office.\nFraud is something Medicare and Medicaid take very seriously, Dara Corrigan, deputy administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a statement to CNBC.\n\"We continuously work to safeguard taxpayer dollars and strengthen program integrity in our operations by identifying vulnerabilities in the system,\" she said. \"CMS uses every tool we have to lower the risk of fraud and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and collaboratively works with law enforcement to identify and investigate fraud and abuse.\"\nIn another scheme, inspector general agents in 2021 found $2.5 million in cash wrapped in plastic tucked inside PVC pipes under the home of Jesus Garces. He is serving a 12½-year sentence after he pleaded guilty that year to one count of conspiracy to commit health-care fraud and wire fraud. Garces was operating a fraudulent Medicare company out of a strip mall, Pérez Aybar said. A government informant recorded Garces on a hidden camera smiling as he counted cash he stole from Medicare, according to investigators and a copy of the video obtained by CNBC.\n\"We were shocked to know that there was this amount of cash,\" Pérez Aybar said. \"I think a lot of us hadn't necessarily seen that much, but it was how it had been packaged, vacuum sealed in bricks, again, stuffed into PVC pipes. And it really was, for us, an indication of how brazen this [durable medical equipment] fraud is.\"\nGarces \"thought he was a CEO, when in fact he was just a crook,\" Pérez Aybar said.\nRicardo Carcas, the special agent who oversaw the Garces case, explained how these schemes typically work.\n\"When I show up, I see that it is the shell that we typically see in this durable medical equipment fraud scheme,\" Carcas said, pointing to the storefront in a Miami strip mall where Garces set up his fraudulent medical device company. \"It was empty pretty much — it just had a desk (and) a shelf with maybe three orthotic braces in there. And it was closed during operating hours.\"\nTo prove it was fraudulent, Carcas said he identified the referring doctors who supposedly signed off on patients who were billing their medical equipment to Medicare. None of the patients saw those doctors.\n\"They purchased a list of patient information,\" Pérez Aybar said. \"They have doctors that they either are using as part of the scheme, they're paying kickbacks, or they may purchase a list of doctors' information as well, and then you start submitting the claims. Once the money gets into the bank account, they have money launderers and mules that they paid to go out and just pull the money out of those accounts.\"\nPérez Aybar described battling the fraudsters as \"almost like the game of whack-a-mole, where we hit one and another pops up.\"\nOn the ground, agents fighting health-care fraud see a never-ending scenario.\nTake the Miami Merchandise Mart, for instance.\nThe sprawling, aging indoor mall houses low-cost, wholesale retailers along with numerous medical supply businesses set up to bilk the government, according to investigators.\nWhen CNBC visited the mall in December, there were numerous storefronts that were largely empty, but for the names of the medical supply companies that adorned the entrances.\nPérez Aybar described what agents have found at the mall and elsewhere during previous investigations.\n\"It is Medicare regulations that you have to have a business, especially in this case for durable medical equipment. And so usually what — when we go out, what I will see is just a bit of a shell. It's an office that's maybe 12 by 15 feet wide,\" he said.\n\"There's a desk, perhaps, there's a bit of a curio with one or two different types of braces. They'll have the manuals that Medicare requires that — that they're familiar with. And usually there's some type of partition if let's say we're talking about orthotics because the patient is supposed to come in and actually get fitted.\"\nAlong a corridor in the mall, CNBC found a young woman sitting alone at a desk in a small glass-enclosed store called United Med Supply Market Inc. She said it was a medical supply business and gave us the business card with a phone number for the owner.

Dr. King recognized that economic opportunity was inextricably linked to civil rights and had come to Memphis as part of his broader Poor People's Campaign for economic justice. His approach was rooted in a belief that ending racial inequality was impossible without economic equity and that racism holds back economic growth for everyone.\nAs we approach both the second anniversary of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan on Saturday — and the 55th anniversary of Dr. King's speech, it is worth considering why economic equity is so central to President\neconomic strategy. It is part of an economic agenda that Treasury Secretary\nhas called \"modern supply-side economics\" — expanding our nation's economic capacity by investing in its human capital, labor supply, public infrastructure, and sustainability — especially in underserved communities.\nThe Biden-Harris administration has spent the last two years making exactly these kinds of investments. The historic gains our economy has made over the last two years lend support to our economic strategy of unlocking the unrealized potential of marginalized Americans to build an economy that works for everyone.\nWhen President Biden took office, our country faced its greatest economic challenge in generations. One of our key objectives was to prevent economic scarring. That's the long-term, permanent economic damage from shocks like job loss or eviction that prevents people and households fully getting back on their feet. It also ultimately holds back overall growth as those affected are prevented from reaching their potential.\nThis started with policies like the Advance Child Tax Credit, which under the Rescue Plan offered monthly payments to families and helped lift 3.5 million children out of poverty. In addition, actions to prevent evictions such as the Emergency Rental Assistance program, which provides rental payment support to families at risk of eviction, contributed to the prevention of more than 1.3 million evictions during the pandemic.\nLast year, I met a woman named Diamond who lost her job due to the pandemic — and nearly lost her home. But instead, federal eviction-prevention funds kept a roof over her head, allowed her to enroll in training for a new career, and helped keep her daughter in the same school. This assistance did more than prevent the worst-case outcome — it helped unlock new opportunity for Diamond and her daughter.\nExpanding our labor force is another area where efforts to support communities of color and other underserved communities is helping to unleash economic gains for all Americans. Today, employers across numerous industries report that they are struggling with a labor shortage. We have already made great strides to bring more workers into the labor force. But even so, giving more Americans in communities of color and rural areas the ability to access strong employment opportunities would benefit the entire U.S. economy by both addressing the labor shortage and expanding our economic capacity.\nPresident Biden's policies have sought to address this challenge head-on. Last year, I visited Orlando, Florida, where the mayor took me on a tour of a workforce training center funded by the President's American Rescue Plan. And last month, I visited Spelman College, a historically Black college in Atlanta, which will be a recipient of new Satcher grants that will create opportunities to enter the cybersecurity field at HBCUs and minority-serving institutions, helping to fill a gap of more than 700,000 unfilled cybersecurity jobs nationwide.\nFinally, the Biden administration is building the physical and digital infrastructure needed for all Americans to participate and compete in the 21st century economy. There is no better example of this than the more than $75 billion we are providing to bring reliable, high-speed internet to all Americans. Expanding access to high-speed internet will be the electrification of the 21st century, bringing opportunity to regions that have long faced barriers to full economic participation.\nThe benefits of this effort will be particularly powerful in underserved communities. In dense urban areas, Black households are twice as likely to lack high-speed internet as white households. And across the country, at least 17% of rural Americans lack access to fixed broadband, compared to 1 percent of Americans in urban areas. The investments we are making will close this gap for good and ensure all Americans have the internet access needed to thrive and compete in today's economy.\nFor too long, racism and discrimination have limited the ability of underserved communities to fully contribute to our civic and economic advancement. It is worth recalling that Dr. King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech was not only about civil rights; it was delivered as part of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which explicitly recognized the connection between economic and racial equity. The only way to make Dr. King's dream a reality is to continue our work building an economy that works for everyone."},

Here's a look at the greatest revenue-earning taxes outlined in the plan.\nAll revenue numbers are over the span of the next decade.\nBiden's budget calls for increasing the corporate income tax to 28% from the current 21%. The White House argues the increase is still far below the 35% tax before former President Donald Trump slashed the tax in 2017.\nEnsuring companies \"pay their fair share\" has been a priority for Biden since his campaign and is likely to take center stage on his platform if he decides to run again. The president's economic platform is centered on building the economy \"from the bottom up and middle out\" a direct criticism of so-called \"trickle-down economics\" theories. Increasing taxes on the highest earners, including large corporations, is central to its implementation.\nBiden's budget calls for a minimum 25% tax on American households worth over $100 million, which would more than triple the 8% rate the wealthiest 0.01% currently pay.\n\"No billionaire should be paying a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter,\" Biden said in a speech Thursday in Philadelphia, Pa. after his budget proposal was released. He said there are more than a thousand billionaires in the United States currently, up from 600 when he took office two years ago. Those Americans, the White House argues, should be contributing more.\nBiden's budget calls for increasing the 3.8% Affordable Care Act tax to 5% on Americans earning more than $400,000. The increase would go towards bolstering Medicare.\nThis is another reform that would help shore up Medicare. If enacted, it would close the loophole to ensure the Obamacare tax is always applied to high earners' so-called \"pass-through businesses\" where income flows to individual returns.\nBuilding off of the billionaires' tax, Biden's budget outlines bumping the top payroll tax rate to 39.6%, up from 37%, on Americans making more than $400,000 annually and married couples earning more than $450,000 a year. If enacted, the income tax hike would reverse cuts made by former President Donald Trump in his 2017 tax bill.\nThe new levy placing a 1% tax on all stock buybacks was passed under last year's Inflation Reduction Act and went into effect on Jan.1. It is projected to garner $74 billion over the next ten years. The president though argues it doesn't go far enough to curb share repurchases and proposed in his budget increasing the tax four-fold to 4%. The move, the White House states, would encourage investment in businesses themselves rather than share repurchases and dividends."},

Trump has already declared his candidacy. Pence has not, but he's been laying the groundwork to run.\nIn the days leading up to Jan. 6, 2021, Trump pressured Pence to overturn President Joe Biden's election victory as he presided over the ceremonial certification of the results. Pence refused, and when rioters stormed the Capitol, some chanted that they wanted to \"hang Mike Pence.\"\nThe House committee that investigated the attack said in its final report that \"the President of the United States had riled up a mob that hunted his own Vice President.\"\nWith his remarks, Pence solidified his place in a broader debate within the Republican Party over how to view the attack. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, for example, recently provided Tucker Carlson with an archive of security camera footage from Jan. 6, which the Fox News host has used to downplay the day's events and promote conspiracy theories.\n\"Make no mistake about it, what happened that day was a disgrace,\" Pence said in his Gridiron Dinner remarks. \"And it mocks decency to portray it any other way.\"\nTrump, meanwhile, has continued to spread lies about his election loss. He's even spoken in support of the rioters and said he would consider pardoning them if he was re-elected.\nSpeeches at the Gridiron Dinner are usually humorous affairs, where politicians poke fun at each other, and Pence did plenty of that as well.\nHe joked that Trump's ego was so fragile, he wanted his vice president to sing \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" — one of the lines is \"did you ever know that you're my hero?\" — during their weekly lunches.\nHe took another shot at Trump over classified documents.\n\"I read that some of those classified documents they found at Mar-a-Lago were actually stuck in the president's Bible,\" Pence said. \"Which proves he had absolutely no idea they were there.\"\nEven before the dinner was over, Pence was facing criticism for his jokes about Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, the first openly gay Cabinet member in U.S. history.\nPence mentioned that, despite travel problems that were plaguing Americans, Buttigieg took \"maternity leave\" after he and his husband adopted newborn twins.\n\"Pete is the only person in human history to have a child and everyone else gets post-partum depression,\" Pence said."},

After multiple hearings in the Senate Commerce Committee, it was still unclear if Sohn would have the votes for her nomination to pass the full Senate.\nThe FCC is stuck with only four commissioners, leaving an open seat and making it virtually impossible for Biden to push his internet agenda without bipartisan agreement. In particular, Sohn's withdrawal is a blow to the administration's effort to renew net neutrality rules, which keep broadband internet providers from treating online content unequally.\nDuring a 16-month battle with cable and media industry lobbyists, Sohn said she's been subject to \"unrelenting, dishonest and cruel attacks\" that have taken \"an enormous toll\" on her family.\n\"It is a sad day for our country and our democracy when dominant industries, with assistance from unlimited dark money, get to choose their regulators,\" Sohn said in a statement. \"And with the help of their friends in the Senate, the powerful cable and media companies have done just that.\"\nBiden appeared to give Sohn a vote of confidence earlier this year when he\nher for the position, after her earlier selection had lapsed with the change in Congress.\nRepublicans opposed Sohn's confirmation, in part due to past tweets that were critical of Fox News. But some Democrats also withheld their support, partly because of opposition from a law enforcement group.\nSohn previously worked for former FCC Chair Tom Wheeler during the Obama administration, when the agency approved net neutrality rules that sought to prevent internet service providers from offering fast lanes for certain websites or throttling service for others. The rules were heavily opposed by ISPs at the time. Ajit Pai, the chair under former President Donald Trump,\nrepealed the rules.\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration does not have updates to share about a new candidate.\n\"We appreciate Gigi Sohn's candidacy for this important role,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"She would have brought tremendous intellect and experience, which is why the president nominated her in the first place. We also appreciate her dedication to public service, her talent and her years of work as one of the nation's leading public advocates on behalf of American consumers and competition.\"\nSen.

Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., expressed her disappointment at the decision and voiced her support for Sohn.\n\"I commend her for the integrity and fortitude she displayed in the face of a coordinated, hate-fueled campaign to malign and distort her character and record,\" said Cantwell, chair of the Commerce Committee, in a statement. \"I thank Ms. Sohn for her willingness to serve and her continued efforts to bridge the digital divide in America.\""},

Thorleifsson and Twitter, which no longer has a communications department, did not respond to questions from CNBC on the spat by the time of publication.\nOn Monday, Thorleifsson, 45, tweeted Musk, saying that he had been locked out of his work computer for several days and failed to get a response from Twitter's human resources department on whether he had been fired.\nHe suggested he may have been one of 200 employees\nin February. Thorleifsson lives and works in the Icelandic capital Reykjavik with his wife and two children.\nMusk, an avid user of Twitter, replied by asking Thorleifsson, \"What work have you been doing?\" to which Thorleifsson responded saying he saved the company $500,000 on a software-as-a-service contract and led prioritization of design projects.\nWhen Musk probed for more details, Thorleifsson identified the SaaS contract he saved the company money on as the design platform Figma and said his prioritization work related to \"all active design projects.\"\nMusk proceeded to respond with two laughing face emojis and later tweeted a link to a clip from \"Office Space,\" a comedy movie that parodies office working culture, where an employee is asked, \"What would you say you do here?\"\nFollowing the back-and-forth with Musk, Thorleifsson said he was informed by Twitter's head of human resources that he had been sacked.\nMusk proceeded to criticize Thorleifsson over his work performance at the company, saying he \"did no actual work, claimed as his excuse that he had a disability that prevented him from typing, yet was simultaneously tweeting up a storm.\"\nBilly Markus, co-creator of dogecoin and an ally of Musk, expressed disapproval of Musk's tweets.

Musk agreed to buy the social media site last year for $44 billion.

He suffers from muscular dystrophy, a disease that weakens muscles over time. Thorleifsson explained his disability has made it harder for him to do manual work for extended periods of time without his hands starting to cramp.\nAccording to\n, Thorleifsson was crowned Iceland's \"person of the year\" in 2022 by several Icelandic media outlets, in part due to the sale of Ueno and his efforts to install wheelchair ramps across the country.\nHe says part of the reason why he sold the company — which he described as being on unfavorable financial terms — was that his disability made it harder for him to do manual work.\nThorleifsson says he chose to be paid the deal price as salary since, this way, he could pay more in taxes to contribute to public services.\nIf he took the money as a lump sum, it would have been treated as an investment and he would have paid a 22% capital gains tax. However, by taking it as salary, he opted to pay the higher 46% income tax rate instead.\nThorleifsson said he was in the dark about whether he will receive severance pay. \"Companies let people go, that's within their rights,\" Thorleifsson said on Twitter. \"They usually tell people about it but that's seemingly the optional part at Twitter now.\"\nIt is not yet clear what he will decide to do next — although he said earlier Tuesday that he was planning to open a restaurant named after his mother in downtown Reykjavik \"very soon.\""},

In 2021, the world produced 540 thousand metric tons of lithium and by 2030 the World Economic Forum projects the global demand will reach over 3 million metric tons.\nReserves of lithium have been discovered throughout the\nwith Zimbabwe, Namibia, Ghana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Mali all having notable supplies. The price of lithium has skyrocketed. In May 2022, the price was\nhigher than it was at the start of 2021. Mineral-rich nations like Zimbabwe are taking note.\nZimbabwe has been mining lithium for 60 years and the government estimates that its Chinese-owned Bikita Minerals Mine, which is located 300 kilometers south of the capital Harare, has about\nof lithium resources. The country is the\nof lithium, and the International Trade Administration projects that once it fully exploits its known resources it could potentially meet 20% of the world's demand.\n\"We've seen a lot of investments within the mining sector over the past few years,\" said Prosper Chitambara, a development economist for the Labor and Economic Development Research Institute of Zimbabwe. \"For us to realize the full potential from the mining sector, it means we have to move up the value chain.\"\nIn December 2022, Zimbabwe passed the Base Mineral Export Control Act\n. However, companies that are in the process of developing mines or processing plants in Zimbabwe are exempt from this ban. That includes Chinese firms\n,\nand\nwhich have invested\ninto lithium projects in Zimbabwe.\n\"Any government in the world is bound to react when your resources are just flying in all directions,\" said Farai Maguwu, director of Zimbabwe's Center for Natural Resource Governance. \"However, the lithium concentrate is still being exported lawfully out of the country. I think the government simply wanted to control the lithium that was being extracted by artisanal miners, which was not being accounted for and it was being smuggled out of the country.\"\nArtisanal mining, or small-scale mining, is a largely informal method where individuals use basic tools to extract minerals. The Zimbabwean government estimates that artisanal mining plays a critical role in the livelihood of over 1 million Zimbabweans.\n\"Artisanal miners were the most affected by the ban,\" said Joseph Mujere, a lecturer in Modern African History at the University of York. \"They had already accumulated loads of raw lithium that they were preparing to sell,\" he said.\nThe Center for Natural Resource Governance estimates the government has lost nearly $2 billion in minerals smuggled across the border through artisanal mining leakage.\n\"There are two narratives,\" Maguwu said. \"The political narrative that mining is the savior of the economy. Then the grassroots narrative, which says mining is undermining our livelihoods. We sit in between. We want to see mining contribute to the economy, but not at the expense of the Zimbabwean people.\"\nWhile artisanal miners were affected by the export ban, the Chinese have benefited from its exemptions. Both the Bikita mine, which is the largest lithium mine in the country, and the Arcadia Lithium mine are Chinese owned.\nIn 2022, Chinese mining companies Tsingshan,\nand\ninvested nearly\nin Zimbabwe and in the same year,\nannounced its plans to expand its current production at the Bikita mine by investing\ninto building a new lithium plant.\n\"When we invest in the Chinese and allow them to come and do what the Zimbabweans are capable of doing, we are building China, not Zimbabwe,\" Maguwu said. \"Zimbabweans are saying leave room for the Zimbabwean people.\"\nThe Chinese Embassy in Zimbabwe declined to comment on this statement.\nChina accounts for over\n, and with over 20 years of consistent commitment to African nations it has placed itself in the right position to access the resources needed to continue this trend.\n\"The Chinese have played for keeps,\" said Mvemba Phezo Dizolele, director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"The United States, our relationship is not always permanent. The Chinese are just consistent in that way,\" he said.\nIn December, President Joe Biden welcomed 49 African leaders to Washington, D.C., for the country's second U.S.-African Leaders Summit and its first since the Obama administration.\n\"The United States is all in on Africa's future,\" Biden remarked at the summit.\nThe summit was seen as an important step in trying to restore relations, which were rocky during the Trump administration. Notably missing from the event, however, was Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who has been under U.S. travel sanctions since 2002. Foreign Affairs Minister Frederick Shava attended in his place.\n\"The fact that he came is also still a signal that the U.S. is interested in keeping the door open with Zimbabwe,\" Dizolele said.\nWhile the U.S. has made its intentions clear when it comes to engaging in African business, the reality is China has sunk its roots in the continent. It will be tough for the U.S. to make up for the lost time. In 2009, China overtook the U.S. as Africa's largest trading partner. The country has grown from $121 million in total traded goods with Africa in 1950 to $254 billion in 2021, compared to the U.S. which sat at $64 billion in 2021.\n\"America has not been consistent in the way it engages with Africa,\" said Dizolele. \"If you leave and come back 10 years later, that void you left will be filled by somebody else, so it's important that we be consistent.\""},

This shows how AI such as ChatGPT may soon play a significant role in business, with companies such as Salesforce and Microsoft beginning to offer tighter integration between the chatbot and their software.\nA recent viral TikTok video showed how it's possible to use ChatGPT integrated with Google Sheets to write custom LinkedIn messages to executives asking for a meeting. It identified 10 potential companies in an industry and their CEOs, and generated different outreach notes for each one, including a unique question to ask.\n\"I think we're at a very interesting inflection point of how we'll begin to use AI in the future in our day-to-day lives that wasn't as easily accessible even six months ago, before ChatGPT was more readily available to the public,\" said\n.

Microsoft and Google are working to integrate next-level chatbots into search engines. Companies are working on using these bots to write marketing copy or computer code.\nKlufas' video illustrates how the particularly promising application could be commercialized in the near future: Using the power of a chatbot to quickly write and automate emails with a little bit of personalization, perhaps for sales, marketing or personal networking. Microsoft and Salesforce announced new products this week with that exact feature.\nFinancial analysts at Credit Suisse pointed to email generation several times in a note earlier this month as a concrete and near-term use for the technology. The analysts estimated Microsoft's recently announced generative AI sales features could help it take market share and potentially add over $768 million in annual revenue.\nOn Tuesday, Salesforce\ncalled EinsteinGPT, which uses an OpenAI ChatGPT model. It can automatically write marketing emails — a logical integration because Salesforce's main product is a web app that keeps track of how often salespeople contact leads.\nIn a tweet Tuesday, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff demonstrated the software, using it to identify two contacts at a company, then automatically generating a one-sentence email trying to arrange a meeting. In the demo, EinsteinGPT softened the cold outreach email after the user told the software to be less formal.\nSalesforce hasn't set a price for the tools yet but said it's in testing now with pilot customers.\nMicrosoft announced Monday that it would integrate generative AI based on ChatGPT into a set of tools for business\n. One of its primary features is using AI to generate emails.\nIn a demo video, Microsoft showed the feature integrated into an Outlook mailbox and provided examples of using it to reply to a request for a proposal or to suggest a meeting time with a customer.\nIn the example, an inbound email wanted to follow up on a potential sales deal, and Microsoft's feature offered four different draft replies, including one that offered a discount and another that addressed a concern.\nMicrosoft said its AI email writer can take important context from the email thread, like the price that was previously discussed, and stick it in the response drafted by AI. In the example provided by Microsoft, the user edits the AI draft before sending it.\nMicrosoft's feature is currently in beta testing but will be released to customers of Microsoft's Viva Sales feature on March 15, the company said Monday.\nSome startups have even trained their sights on developing customized AIs that can respond to messages the same way a user would, by analyzing a user's previous email and text interactions and integrating it into a personalized AI model.\n\"The benefit is people who would want to communicate with you where you don't have time to get back to them, where you don't have time to offer your mind,\" said Suman Kanuganti, founder of\n, a chatbot currently in beta mode. \"In those scenarios, you can choose to either have your AI help you in co-pilot mode or offer [automatic] responses to them in autopilot mode.\"\nSome worry that the ability to generate email text could be abused to spam people and that chatbots could be used to phish for people's private passwords.\n\"We could see mass targeted messages and spam indistinguishable from dedicated email,\" JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note this month that examined the AI industry.\nChatGPT is also prone to \"hallucinating,\" or making stuff up. It merely predicts what the next word or part of a phrase should be based on statistics and doesn't know whether it's correct or not.\nMicrosoft said in its announcement that it would use data from its software to ground the replies in facts and has a thumbs-down button so users can tell the bot that a response was unhelpful. That helps train the model to avoid the same mistake in the future.\nA Salesforce executive\nthat it was moving as quickly as it could without compromising a responsible, ethical approach.\nBut the limits of ChatGPT were clearly visible in the viral TikTok video. While some recommendations were correct, several of the CEOs ChatGPT recommended for outreach are either former CEOs or not executives at the company. While the text for the cold outreach looked appropriate, it would still likely require a human to make sure everything was actually right.\n\"I think anyone using this technology, as nascent as it is, has to do that due diligence,\" Klufas said. She said she didn't actually send the emails she generated by ChatGPT.\nBut she's still excited about using ChatGPT to help her make TikToks and other content for social media.

Billions of dollars in venture capital flow into and out of the bank's coffers.\nBut the 40-year-old firm's intimate ties to technology leave it particularly sensitive to the industry's boom-and-bust cycles, and on Thursday those risks became abundantly clear.\nSVB was forced into a fire sale of its securities, unloading $21 billion worth its holdings at a $1.8 billion loss, while also raising $500 million from venture firm General Atlantic, according to a\nlate Wednesday. After its stock soared 75% in the 2021 market rally, SVB lost two-thirds of its value last year and then\nanother 60% during regular trading on Thursday and an additional 22% after the close.\nFor the Silicon Valley region, the troubles land at a particularly difficult time. Venture capital deal activity sank over 30% last year to $238 billion, according to\n. While that's still a historically high number, the dearth of initial public offerings and continuing drawdown in valuations among once highfliers suggests that there's much more pain to come in 2023.\nAs a large regulated bank, SVB has been viewed as a stabilizing force. But its latest financial maneuvers are raising alarm bells among the firm's client base.\n\"Psychologically, it's a blow because everyone realizes how fragile things can be,\" said Scott Orn, operating chief at\n, which helps startups with tax, accounting and human resources services.\nOrn called SVB a \"crown jewel of Silicon Valley\" and a \"strong franchise\" that he expects to survive this difficult period and even potentially get acquired by a bigger bank. For his customers, which number in the hundreds, a pullback by SVB would likely make it more expensive to borrow money.\n\"Losing a major debt provider in the venture debt market could drive the cost of funds up,\" Orn said.\nAccording to SVB's mid-quarter update, one of the primary problems the bank faces has to do with the amount of money its customers are spending. Total client funds have fallen for the last five quarters, as cash burn has continued at a rapid pace despite the slowdown in venture investing.\n\"Client cash burn remains ~2x higher than pre-2021 levels and has not adjusted to the slower fundraising environment,\" SVB said.\nIn January, SVB expected average deposits for the first quarter to be $171 billion to $175 billion. That forecast is now down to $167 billion to $169 billion. SVB anticipates clients will continue to burn cash at essentially the same level as they did in the last quarter of 2022, when economic tightening was already well underway.\nAnalysts at DA Davidson wrote in a report on Thursday that in terms of spending, \"companies have not adjusted to the slower fundraising environment.\" The firm has a neutral rating on the stock and said concerns \"over a slow to recover VC environment have kept us cautious on SIVB shares.\"\nS&P lowered its rating on SVB to BBB- from BBB, leaving it just one notch above its junk rating. On Wednesday, Moody's reduced SVB to Baa1 from A3, reflecting \"the deterioration in the bank's funding, liquidity and profitability, which prompted SVB to announce actions to restructure its balance sheet.\"\nConcern has quickly turned to the potential contagion effect. Does the bank's acknowledged misfortunes lead clients to pull their money and house it elsewhere? That question was circling among investors and tech execs on Thursday, even after CEO Greg Becker wrote in a letter to shareholders that the bank has \"ample liquidity and flexibility to manage our liquidity position.\"\n\"More in the VC community need to speak out publicly to quell the panic about @SVB_Financial,\" Mark Suster of Upfront Ventures\non Twitter. \"I believe their CEO when he says they are solvent and not in violation of any banking ratios\ngoal was to raise & strengthen balance sheet.\"\nSuster funds the kinds of risk-taking and future-oriented ventures that rely on SVB for banking services.\nIn the case studies' section of the firm's website, for example, SVB highlights a loan to solar panel provider\n, debt offerings to autonomous construction equipment vendor Built Robotics and financing solutions for ocean drone startup Saildrone.\nSVB's loan losses remain low, meaning that at least for now it's not facing the kind of credit challenges the bank dealt with during the dot-com crash and financial crisis, when charge-offs soared. Rather, analysts are focused on the deposit side of the house.\n\"Given the pressure on their end markets, especially the elevated levels of client cash burn, SIVB is seeing continued material outflows of client funds, both on- and off-balance sheet,\" wrote analysts at Wedbush, who have the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock. That recommendation is \"based on SIVB's growth normalizing after an exceptional 2020-2021 and our belief that the VC market could remain challenged for the next couple quarters.\"\nMoody's downgrade specifically pointed to concerns about the bank's risk profile, pointing out that the \"balance of shareholder and creditor interests posed higher than average governance challenges.\"\nSVB still managed to find reasons for optimism. In a section of its report titled \"Continued Underlying Momentum,\" the bank noted that private equity and venture capital dry powder hit a record high in January to the tune of $2.6 trillion, an indication that there's plenty of cash out there for startups.\nSVB can only hope that it remains a trusted financial source for companies as they look to eventually store a good chunk of that money."},

Telcos think these firms should pay \"fair share\" fees to account for their disproportionate infrastructure needs and help fund the rollout of next-generation 5G and fiber networks.\nThe European Commission, the EU's executive arm, opened a consultation last month examining how to address the imbalance. Officials are seeking views on whether to require a direct contribution from internet giants to the telco operators.\nBig Tech firms say this would amount to an \"internet tax\" that could undermine net neutrality.\nTop telecom bosses came out swinging at the tech companies during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.\nThey bemoaned spending billions on laying cables and installing antennas to cope with rising internet demand without corresponding investments from Big Tech.\n\"Without the telcos, without the network, there is no Netflix, there is no Google,\" Michael Trabbia, chief technology and innovation officer for France's Orange, told CNBC. \"So we are absolutely vital, we are the entry point to the digital world.\"\nIn a Feb. 27 presentation, the CEO of German telecom group\n, Tim Hoettges, showed audience members a rectangular illustration, representing the scale of market capitalization among different industry participants. U.S. giants dominated this map.\nHoettges asked attendees why these companies couldn't \"at least a little bit, contribute to the efforts and the infrastructure which we are building here in Europe.\"\nHoward Watson, chief technology officer of BT, said he sees merit in a fee for the large tech players.\n\"Can we get a two-sided model to work, where the customer pays the operator, but also the content provider pays the operator?\" Watson told CNBC last week. \"I do think we should be looking at that.\"\nWatson drew an analogy to Google and Apple's app stores, which charge developers a cut of in-app sales in return to use their services.\nEfforts to implement network fees have been strongly criticized — not least by tech companies.\nSpeaking on Feb. 28 at MWC, Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters labeled proposals to make tech firms pay internet service providers for network costs an internet traffic \"tax,\" which would have an \"adverse effect\" on consumers.\nRequiring the likes of Netflix — which already spends heavily on content delivery — to pay for network upgrades would make it harder to develop popular shows, Peters said.\nTech firms say that carriers already receive money to invest in infrastructure from their customers — who pay them via call, text and data fees — and that, by asking internet companies to pay for carriage, they effectively want to get paid twice.\nConsumers may end up absorbing costs asked of digital content platforms, and this could ultimately \"have a negative impact on consumers, especially at a time of price increases,\" Matt Brittin, Google's head of EMEA, said in September.\nTech firms also argue that they are already making large investments in European telco infrastructure, including subsea cables and server farms.\nThe \"fair share\" debate has sparked some concern that the principles of net neutrality — which say the internet should be free, open, and not give priority to any one service — could be undermined. Telcos insist they're not trying to erode net neutrality.\nTechnology firms worry that those who pay more for infrastructure may get better network access.\nGoogle's Brittin said that fair share payments \"could potentially translate into measures that effectively discriminate between different types of traffic and infringe the rights of end users.\"\nOne suggestion is to require individual bargaining deals with the Big Tech firms, similar to Australian licensing models between news publishers and internet platforms.\n\"This has nothing to do with net neutrality. This has nothing to do with access to the network,\" said Sigve Brekke, CEO of Telenor, told CNBC on Feb. 27. \"This has to do with the burden of cost.\"\nCarriers gripe that their networks are congested by a huge output from tech giants. One solution is to stagger content delivery at different times to ease the burden on network traffic.\nDigital content providers could time a new blockbuster movie or game releases more efficiently, or compress the data delivered to ease the pressure off networks.\n\"We could just start with having a clear schedule of what's coming when, and being able to have a dialogue as to whether companies are using the most efficient way of carrying the traffic, and could certain non-time critical content be delivered at different times?\" Marc Allera, CEO of BT's consumer division, told CNBC.\n\"I think that's a pretty, relatively easy debate to be had, actually, although a lot of the content is global, and what might be busy in one country and one time may or may not be busy in another. But I think at a local level is certainly a really easy discussion to have.\"\nHe suggested the net neutrality concept needs a bit of a refresh.\nThe \"fair share\" debate is as old as time. For over a decade, telecom operators have complained about over-the-top messaging and media services like WhatsApp and Skype \"free riding\" on their networks.\nAt this year's MWC, there was one notable difference — a high-ranking EU official in the room.\nThierry Breton, head of internal markets for the European Commission, said the bloc must \"find a financing model for the huge investments needed\" in the development of next-generation mobile networks and emerging technologies, like the metaverse.\nBreton said it was important not to undermine net neutrality and that the debate should not be characterized as a \"binary choice\" between internet service providers and Big Tech firms.\nBreton's presence at MWC appeared to reflect the bloc's sympathies toward Big Telecom, according to Paolo Pescatore, tech, media and telecom analyst at PP Foresight.\n\"The challenge in Europe is it's not that clear cut because you have an imbalance,\" Pescatore said. \"The imbalance is not down to Big Tech, it's not down to streamers, and it's not down to telcos. It's down largely to the old, out-of-date regulatory environment.\"\nA lack of cross-border consolidation and stagnating revenues in the telecoms sector created a \"perfect concoction that's unfavorable to telcos,\" he said.\n\"A potential landing zone for resolution is a framework for telcos to negotiate individually with the tech firms that generate the heaviest traffic,\" Ahmad Latif Ali,  European telecommunications insights lead at IDC, told CNBC. \"However, this is a highly contested situation.\"\nWATCH:"},

What followed was the rapid collapse of a highly-respected bank that had grown alongside its technology clients.\nEven now, as the dust begins to settle on the second bank wind-down\nthis week, members of the VC community are lamenting the role that other investors played in SVB's demise.\n\"This was a hysteria-induced bank run caused by VCs,\" Ryan Falvey, a fintech investor at Restive Ventures, told CNBC. \"This is going to go down as one of the ultimate cases of an industry cutting its nose off to spite its face.\"\nThe episode is the latest fallout from the\n's actions to stem inflation with its most aggressive rate hiking campaign in four decades. The ramifications could be far-reaching, with concerns that startups may be\nemployees in coming days, venture investors may struggle to raise funds, and an already-battered sector could face a deeper malaise.\nThe roots of SVB's collapse stem from dislocations spurred by higher rates. As startup clients withdrew deposits to keep their companies afloat in a chilly environment for IPOs and private fundraising, SVB found itself short on capital. It had been forced to sell all of its available-for-sale bonds at a $1.8 billion loss, the bank said late Wednesday.\nThe sudden need for fresh capital, coming on the heels of the collapse of crypto-focused\nbank, sparked another wave of deposit withdrawals Thursday as VCs instructed their portfolio companies to move funds, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The concern: a bank run at SVB could pose an existential threat to startups who couldn't tap their deposits.\nSVB customers said CEO Greg Becker didn't instill confidence when he urged them to \"stay calm\" during a call that began Thursday afternoon.

While insured deposits are expected to be available as early as Monday, the lion's share of deposits held by SVB were uninsured, and it's unclear when they will be freed up.\n\"The precipitous deposit withdrawal has caused the Bank to be incapable of paying its obligations as they come due,\" the California financial regulator stated. \"The bank is now insolvent.\""},

Clients that turn to SVB for loans also tend to store their deposits with the bank.\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which became the receiver of SVB, insures $250,000 of deposits per client. Because SVB serves mostly businesses, those limits don't mean much. As of December, roughly 95% of SVB's deposits were uninsured, according to filings with the SEC.\nThe FDIC said in a\nthat insured depositors will have access to their money by Monday morning.\nBut the process is much more convoluted for uninsured depositors. They'll receive a dividend within a week covering an undetermined amount of their money and a \"receivership certificate for the remaining amount of their uninsured funds.\"\n\"As the FDIC sells the assets of Silicon Valley Bank, future dividend payments may be made to uninsured depositors,\" the regulator said. Typically, the FDIC would put the assets and liabilities in the hands of another bank, but in this case it created a separate institution, the Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara (DINB), to take care of insured deposits.\nClients with uninsured funds — anything over $250,000 — don't know what to do. Gilbert said he's advising portfolio companies individually, instead of sending out a mass email, because every situation is different. He said the universal concern is meeting payroll for March 15.\nGilbert is also a limited partner in over 50 venture funds. On Thursday, he received several messages from firms regarding capital calls, or the money that investors in the funds send in as transactions take place.\n\"I got emails saying saying don't send money to SVB, and if you have let us know,\" Gilbert said.\nThe concerns regarding payroll are more complex than just getting access to frozen funds, because many of those services are handled by third parties that were working with SVB.\nRippling, a back office-focused startup, handles payroll services for many tech companies. On Friday morning, the company sent a note to clients telling them that, because of the SVB news, it was moving \"key elements of our payments infrastructure\" to\n.\n\"You need to inform your bank immediately about an important change to the way Rippling debits your account,\" the memo said. \"If you do not make this update, your payments, including payroll, will fail.\"\nRippling CEO Parker Conrad said in a series of tweets on Friday that some payments are getting delayed amid the FDIC process.\n\"Our top priority is to get our customers' employees paid as soon as we possibly can, and we're working diligently toward that on all available channels, and trying to learn what the FDIC takeover means for today's payments,\" Conrad wrote.\nOne founder, who asked to remain anonymous, told CNBC that everyone is scrambling. He said he's spoken with more than 30 other founders, and talked to a finance chief from a billion-dollar startup who has tried to move more than $45 million out of SVB to no avail. Another company with 250 employees told him that SVB has \"all our cash.\"\nA SVB spokesperson pointed CNBC back to the\nwhen asked for comment.\nFor the FDIC, the immediate goal is to quell fears of systemic risk to the banking system, said\n, who teaches finance at Boston University. Williams is quite familiar with the topic as well as the history of SVB. He used to work as a bank regulator in San Francisco.\nWilliams said the FDIC has always tried to work swiftly and to make depositors whole, even if when the money is uninsured. And according to SVB's audited financials, the bank has the cash available — its assets are greater than its liabilities — so there's no apparent reason why clients shouldn't be able to retrieve the bulk of their funds, he said.\n\"Bank regulators understand not moving quickly to make SVB's uninsured depositors whole would unleash significant contagion risk to the broader banking system,\" Williams said.\nTreasury Secretary\non Friday met with leaders from the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regarding the SVB meltdown. The Treasury Department said in a\nthat Yellen \"expressed full confidence in banking regulators to take appropriate actions in response and noted that the banking system remains resilient and regulators have effective tools to address this type of event.\"\nOn the ground in Silicon Valley, the process has been far from smooth. Some execs told CNBC that, by sending in their wire transfer early on Thursday, they were able to successfully move their money. Others who took action later in the day are still waiting — in some cases, for millions of dollars — and are uncertain if they'll be able to meet their near-term obligations.\nRegardless of if and how quickly they're able to get back up and running, companies are going to change how they think about their banking partners, said Matt Brezina, a partner at Ford Street Ventures and investor in startup bank Mercury.\nBrezina said that after payroll, the biggest issue his companies face is accessing their debt facilities, particularly for those in financial technology and labor marketplaces.\n\"Companies are going to end up diversifying their bank accounts much more coming out of this,\" Brezina said. \"This is causing a lot of pain and headaches for lots of founders right now. And it's going to hit their employees and customers too.\"\nSVB's rapid failure could also serve as a wakeup call to regulators when it comes to dealing with banks that are heavily concentrated in a particular industry, Williams said. He said that SVB has always been overexposed to tech even though it managed to survive the dot-com crash and financial crisis.\nIn its\n, which began the downward spiral on Wednesday, SVB said it was selling securities at a loss and raising capital because startup clients were continuing to burn cash at a rapid clip despite the ongoing slump in fundraising. That meant SVB was struggling to maintain the necessary level of deposits.\nRather than sticking with SVB, startups saw the news as troublesome and decided to rush for the exits, a swarm that gained strength as\nportfolio companies to get their money out. Williams said SVB's risk profile was always a concern.\n\"It's a concentrated bet on an industry that it's going to do well,\" Williams said. \"The liquidity event would not have occurred if they weren't so concentrated in their deposit base.\"\nSVB was started in 1983 and, according to its\n, was conceived by co-founders Bill Biggerstaff and Robert Medearis over a poker game. Williams said that story is now more appropriate than ever.\n\"It started as the result of a poker game,\" Williams said. \"And that's kind of how it ended.\""},

While cryptocurrency prices rallied Sunday night after the federal government stepped in to provide a backstop for depositors in two of the banks, the events sparked instability in the stablecoin market.\n, a central lender to the crypto industry,\nthat it would be winding down operations and liquidating its bank. Silicon Valley Bank, a major lender to startups, collapsed on Friday after depositors withdrew more than $42 billion following the bank's Wednesday statement that it needed to raise\nto shore up its balance sheet. Signature, which also had a strong crypto focus but was much larger than Silvergate, was\nby banking regulators.\nSignature and Silvergate were the two main banks for crypto companies, and nearly half of all U.S. venture-backed startups kept cash with Silicon Valley Bank, including crypto-friendly venture capital funds and some digital asset firms.\nThe federal government stepped in on Sunday to guarantee all deposits for SVB and Signature depositors, adding confidence and sparking a small rally in the crypto markets. Both\nand\nare nearly 10% higher in the last 24 hours.\nAccording to Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures, the government's willingness to backstop both banks signifies that it's back in the mode of providing liquidity, rather than tightening, and loose monetary policy has historically proven to be a boon for cryptocurrencies and other speculative asset classes.\nBut the instability once again showed the vulnerability of stablecoins, a subset of the crypto ecosystem investors can typically rely on to maintain a set price. Stablecoins are supposed to be pegged to the value of a real-world asset, such as a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar or a commodity like gold. But unusual financial conditions can cause them to drop below their pegged value.\nA lot of crypto's problems in the last year originated in the stablecoin sector, beginning with\n. Meanwhile, regulators have been homing in on stablecoins in the last few weeks.

Within the digital assets ecosystem, Circle has long been regarded as one of the adults in the room, boasting close connections and backing from the world of traditional finance. It raised $850 million from investors like BlackRock and Fidelity and had long said it planned to go public.\nDAI, another popular dollar-pegged virtual currency that is partially backed by USDC, traded as low as 90 cents on Saturday.

Both allowed commercial clients to make payments 24 hours a day, seven days a week, through their respective instant settlement services.\n\"Bitcoin liquidity and crypto liquidity overall will be somewhat impaired because Signet and SEN were key for firms to get fiat in on the weekend,\" said Carter, who added that he is hopeful that customer banks will step in to fill the void left by SEN and Signet.\n\"These were the two most bitcoin-friendly banks, supporting the lion's share of fiat settlement for bitcoin trades between trading counterparties in the U.S.,\" wrote Mike Brock in a post on social media app Damus. Brock is the CEO of TBD at Block, a unit which focuses on cryptocurrency and decentralized finance.\nAlthough Carter thinks the Fed stepping in to guarantee depositors of SVB will prevent a larger bank run on Monday, he says it is still dispiriting to see the three largest crypto-friendly banks taken offline in a matter of days.\n\"There are very few options now for crypto firms and the industry will be strapped for liquidity until new banks step in,\" said Carter.\nMike Bucella, a longtime investor and executive in the crypto space, says that many in the industry are pivoting to Mercury and Axos, two other banks that cater to startups. Meanwhile, Circle has already publicly said that it is shifting is assets to BNY Mellon now that Signature bank is closing.\n\"Near-term, crypto banking in North America is a tough place,\" said Bucella. \"However there is a long tail of challenger banks that may take up that slack.\""},

A decade after Prime Air's launch, Amazon was starting drone deliveries in two small markets, bringing one of founder\ndreams closer to reality.\nIn the video, which was obtained by CNBC, Carbon told employees that Prime Air had recently kicked off durability and reliability (D&R) testing, a key federal regulatory requirement needed to prove Amazon's drones can fly over people and towns.\n\"We started D&R and we're into D&R as of the time of this filming by about 12 flights,\" Carbon said. \"So, really excited to get that behind us.\"\nHowever, there's a cavernous gap between starting the process and finishing it, and employees could be forgiven for expressing skepticism.\nSince at least last March, Carbon has been telling Prime Air staffers that D&R testing is underway, according to people who worked on the project and requested anonymity because they aren't authorized to discuss it. He even had baseball caps made that said \"D&R 2022\" with the Prime Air logo on them.\nBut the Federal Aviation Administration didn't provide clearance for testing until December, and the company began the campaign shortly after, in January of this year, Amazon said. Before a broader rollout, Prime Air must complete several hundred hours of flying without any incidents and then submit that data to the FAA, which oversees the approval process for commercial deliveries.\nThat all stands in the way of Prime Air's expansion and its efforts to achieve Amazon's wildly ambitious goal of whisking food, medicine and household products to shoppers' doorsteps in 30 minutes or less.\nBezos\na decade ago that a fleet of Amazon drones would take to the skies in about five years. But as of now, drone delivery is restricted to two test markets — College Station, Texas, and Lockeford, California, a town of about 3,500 people located south of Sacramento.\nEven in those hand-picked areas, operations have been hamstrung by FAA restrictions that prohibit the service from flying over people or roads, according to government records. That comes after years of challenges with crashes, missed deadlines and high turnover.\nSo, while Prime Air has signed up about 1,400 customers for the service between the two sites, it can only deliver to a handful of homes, three former employees said. In all, CNBC spoke to seven current and former Prime Air employees who said continued friction between Amazon and the FAA has slowed progress in getting drone delivery off the ground. They asked to remain anonymous because they weren't authorized to speak on the matter.\nAmazon told CNBC that thousands of residents have expressed interest in its drone-delivery service. The company said it's making deliveries to a limited number of customers, with plans to expand over time.\nCEO Andy Jassy, who succeeded Bezos in mid-2021, hasn't talked a lot about Prime Air in public. He's got much bigger problems to solve as Amazon navigates a period of deep\nwhile trying to reaccelerate its business after\nwas the slowest in the company's quarter century on the public market.\nBut Jassy also wants to maintain a culture that's thrived on big bets and risk-taking. His leadership circle, known as the S-team had previously set a goal of beginning drone deliveries in two locations by the end of 2022, according to two employees.\nIn January, a significant number of Prime Air workers were let go as part of the largest round of layoffs in Amazon's history, totaling more than 18,000 people,\n. Prime Air sites in Lockeford, College Station and Pendleton, Oregon, were all hit by the job cuts, further straining operations.\nThe Lockeford site is now down to one pilot certified to operate commercial flights, a former employee said, so days after the layoffs were announced, Amazon flew a staffer there from College Station to help with deliveries.\nNot that there's much activity. Employees told CNBC that the Lockeford location can only deliver to two homes, which are located next door to one another and sit less than a mile from Amazon's facility. Some details of the FAA restrictions were previously reported by\nand\n.\nEmployees who remain after the layoffs told CNBC that morale in the division has continued to sink since the cuts. With more work to do and less clarity on their parent company's ongoing commitment to the mission, some are saying that they and their colleagues have started searching for jobs.\nMaria Boschetti, an Amazon spokesperson, said in a statement that the layoffs and delays experienced by Prime Air haven't affected its long-term plans for deliveries. The company is staffed to meet all applicable FAA requirements for safe operations and safety standards, she said.\n\"We're as excited about it now as we were 10 years ago — but hard things can take time, this is a highly regulated industry, and we're not immune to changes in the macro environment,\" Boschetti said. \"We continue to work closely with the FAA, and have a robust testing program and a team of hundreds in place who will continue to meet all regulatory requirements as we move forward and safely bring this service to more customers in more communities.\"\nPrime Air's FAA problem is not a new phenomenon, and the company has long been working to try to maneuver through restrictions that limit its flying capabilities.\nOf particular note was an effort in late 2021 to get a key rule changed. On Nov. 29 of that year, Sean Cassidy, Prime Air's director of safety, flight operations and regulatory affairs, wrote to the FAA seeking relief from an order that dictates the operational conditions for Amazon's drones, according to government filings.\nCassidy said in the letter that Amazon's new MK27-2 drone had several safety upgrades from the earlier model, the MK27, that rendered many of the \"conditions and limitations\" set by the FAA obsolete. Among the restrictions Amazon sought to remove was a provision prohibiting Prime Air from flying its drones nearby or over people, roads and structures.\nA year later, in November 2022, the FAA declined Amazon's request. The agency said Amazon did not provide sufficient data to show that the MK27-2 could operate safely under those circumstances.\n\"Full durability and reliability parameters have not been established to permit\" flying over or near people, the FAA said.\nIt was a surprising setback for Amazon. In early 2022, the company was so confident the FAA would soon lift the restrictions that, according to five employees, it paid for around three dozen staffers to temporarily live in hotels and Airbnbs in the area of Pendleton, a small town in rural eastern Oregon that's about a three-hour drive from Portland.\nUpon lifting of the restrictions, Amazon intended to move the workers to Lockeford and College Station, with the goal of beginning deliveries in the summer of 2022, the employees said.\nBut by October, the Pendleton crew was still \"living out of their suitcases,\" one employee said, while the company paid for their room and board.\nThe following month, Prime Air moved the employees to their respective sites, just in time for the FAA to deny Amazon's effort for a reprieve. But the company opted to proceed anyway. On Christmas Eve, Carbon announced\nthat Prime Air had made its first deliveries in College Station and Lockeford.\n\"These are careful first steps that we will turn into giant leaps for our customers over the next number of years,\" Carbon wrote.\nBoschetti said Prime Air's delivery team received \"extensive training\" at the Pendleton flight test facility before they were sent to delivery locations.\nSome staffers viewed the launch as a rushed effort and questioned how the service would be able to operate fully without the ability to fly over roads or cars, former employees said.\nWhat's more, demand from Prime Air's tiny customer base isn't exactly soaring. At the Lockeford site, employees have to regularly contact the two households eligible for delivery to remind them to place orders, and Amazon incentivizes them with gift cards, according to two people familiar with the situation.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is working on development of its next-generation Prime Air drone called the MK30, and known internally as CX-3. At an event in Boston in November, Carbon unveiled a mockup of the unmanned aircraft, which is supposed to be lighter and quieter than the MK27-2.\nAs of January, Carbon was still expressing optimism at his weekly AC/DC chats. He said Prime Air has a target to make of 10,000 deliveries this year between its two test sites, even with the D&R campaign unfinished and the FAA limitations firmly in place.\nCarbon acknowledged that Prime Air \"is not immune to the costs savings\" that Jassy is implementing, but he sounded undeterred.\n\"This year is going to be a big year,\" Carbon said. \"We've got lots going on.\"\nThe MK30, expected to launch in 2024, will have to go through the same regulatory process, including a separate D&R campaign, as well as so-called type certification, an even more rigorous FAA benchmark that allows a company to produce drones at scale.\nIt's not a distinction the FAA is quick to hand out. Of all drone makers vying to deliver commercially, only one\ntype certification — a startup called Matternet."},

One VC said that SVB announcing that it's raising money while at the same time essentially saying that everything is \"fine\" seemed to trigger people's memories of Lehman Brothers, who they remember acted similarly at the time.\n\"So, unfortunately, they repeated mistakes in history, and anyone who lived through that period said, 'Hey, maybe they're not fine; we were told that last time,'\" the VC said.\nSVB attempted to quell fears that it was financially unsound as late as Thursday evening.\nIn one email that SVB sent to a customer, a copy of which CNBC obtained, the bank characterized the rumors about its problems as \"buzz about SVB in the markets\" and attempted to reassure the customer that it \"launched a series of strategic actions to strengthen our financial position, enhance profitability and improve financial flexibility now and in the future.\"\n\"It is business as usual at SVB,\" the bank said in the email to startups. It added toward the end of the email, \"Moreover, we have a 40 year history navigating bear and bull markets and have developed leading risk mitigation capabilities to ensure our long term financial health.\"\nAnother venture capitalist said that a representative from SVB called their firm on Thursday to assuage their fears but that the firm's CFO \"didn't feel that it was reassuring, to say the least.\"\nHowever, one tech CEO was sympathetic to the bank's plight, asking, \"What message would ever reassure you that your money is safe when other people are telling you that there's a fraud happening? There's no message, because it's not a messaging thing. It's the prisoner's dilemma thing ... Everybody at that moment now has to try and imagine what everybody else is going to do.\"\nWhen asked for comment, a representative from SVB referred CNBC back to the FDIC announcement, adding, \"The FDIC will share additional information when it is available.\"\nSeveral venture capitalists quickly told their portfolio companies to move money out of Silicon Valley Bank to other banks, including Merrill Lynch, First Republic and JP Morgan, so they could pay their employees on time next week.\nOne AI startup executive said the company's chief financial officer was quick to handle the situation and it had enough money to pay employees on time. Still, the collapse of SVB left a poor taste in the mouth of the executive, who said the bank's collapse feels like \"unnecessary hysteria.\"\n\"It makes me disappointed in our ecosystem,\" the startup CEO said.\nMany venture capitalists echoed the startup CEO's sentiment that the SVB collapse felt like a self-fulfilling prophecy created by unnecessary panic. Some likened it to a \"Twitter-led bank run,\" as the tech community took to social media to spread information, and, often, panic. One prominent technology CEO told CNBC that numerous startup founders were using Twitter and\n's communication service WhatsApp to send each other rapid-fire updates.\nOne venture capitalist said it was as if someone screamed \"fire in a crowded theater where there is no fire.\"\n\"And then when everyone rushes to the door, they knock over the oil lamp and there is a fire and it burns down the building,\" the venture capitalist said. \"And then that same person [is] standing outside being like, 'See, I told you so.'\"\nAs the panic spread and the FDIC stepped in, companies with funds locked up were reporting problems getting cash out and making payroll.\nOne startup founder told CNBC that \"everyone is scrambling.\" He said he has talked to more than 30 other founders, and that both big and small companies are being affected.\nThe founder added that a CFO from a unicorn startup has tried to move more than $45 million out of SVB to no avail. Another company with 250 employees told the founder that SVB has \"all our cash.\"\nAnother founder said her company's payroll provider moved from SVB to another bank on Thursday, which meant payroll did not run for employees as planned Friday morning. She said she has been over-communicating with employees to alleviate their concerns as much as possible, and she is expecting payroll to hit by the end of the day Friday.\nIn case it doesn't, the company is planning to wire employees who need immediate spot coverage the funds directly, according to an internal memo viewed by CNBC.\n\"A lot of people live down to the dollar in terms of budgeting, and they cannot afford 24-hour delay in their payroll,\" the founder said.\nPayroll service provider Rippling notified some customers Friday that their payments would be delayed due to the bank's \"unexpected solvency challenges,\" CEO Parker Conrad\n. The company accelerated a plan to switch from SVB to JPMorgan Chase but not in time to avoid stalled payments.\nAaron Rubin, CEO of e-commerce logistics startup ShipHero, said he was forced to manually pay some employees Friday, as his company relies on Rippling for payroll services.\n\"We found out this morning that no one got paid,\" he said. \"We started to manually pay our warehouse employees because we didn't have time to manually send payments to everyone.\"\nWarehouse staffers make up roughly a third of ShipHero's 600-person headcount, Rubin said. Remaining staffers, which mostly include customer service and tech employees, will get paid next week.\n\"Our concerns are longer term,\" Rubin added. \"Could some of our customers have liquidity issues? I don't think we know those ripple effects yet. Are we going to have issues getting paid from our customers because they'll have issues?\"\nOn Thursday, Jean Yang, the founder and CEO of monitoring company Akita, attempted to complete an online wire transfer to ensure she could make payroll for her seven-person team, but she found that she couldn't make that sort of transaction by then. She drove to the SVB location on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, a street populated by venture-capital offices.\nThere, she asked a teller for a bank transfer and was told the branch couldn't do it. So she asked for a cashier's check for $1 million. After 20 or 25 minutes the bank handed it over.\nOthers in line were taking out their entire balance. \"I regret not taking out our entire balance now,\" she said.\nOn Friday, Yang returned to the Silicon Valley Bank branch 15 minutes before it opened to remove the remaining money. A line of about 40 people had formed. Gossip spread among those waiting. One person showed a tweet on their phone suggesting that bank employees had been instructed not to come to work. (\nreported on a company memo to this effect.)\nThen an employee came out of the office and offered about 15 copies of an article from the FDIC on the agency's response to the bank's situation. The line disbanded as people realized the bank's fate.\nLater on Friday one of the startup's investors called Yang and offered to help Akita make payroll, she said. \"My hope is that the government bails out people past $250,000,\" she said. \"I know people with tens of millions, hundreds of millions [of dollars] with SVB. I think if they only get $250,000, their companies are going to be wiped out.\"\n\"Now, everyone's waiting to see when the Treasury will step in,\" said another venture investor. \"Hopefully [California Gov.] Gavin Newsom is calling Biden right now and saying, 'This is systemic in our area, but you can see the ripple effects on other banks and their equities and their bonds.' If it's systemic, I think the Treasury will step in like 2007 and '08 and protect the money market accounts, plus will protect the depositor.\"\nThis person added, \"If they don't step in, then people will presume that money's lost. That's going to have huge ramifications on the business environment.\"\n:"},

Powering AI Dungeon's text-generation software was the GPT language technology offered by the\n-backed AI research lab OpenAI. The more people played AI Dungeon, the bigger the bill Latitude had to pay OpenAI.\nCompounding the predicament was that Walton also discovered that content marketers were using AI Dungeon to generate promotional copy, a use for AI Dungeon that his team never foresaw, but ended up adding to the company's AI bill.\nAt its peak in 2021, Walton estimates that Latitude was spending nearly $200,000 a month on OpenAI's so-called generative AI software and Amazon Web Services in order to keep up with the millions of user queries it needed to process each day.\n\"We joked that we had human employees and we had AI employees, and we spent about as much on each of them,\" Walton said. \"We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars a month on AI and we are not a big startup, so it was a very massive cost.\"\nBy the end of 2021, Latitude switched from using OpenAI's GPT software to a cheaper but still capable language software offered by startup AI21 Labs, Walton said, adding that the startup also incorporated open source and free language models into its service to lower the cost. Latitude's generative AI bills have dropped to under $100,000 a month, Walton said, and the startup charges players a monthly subscription for more advanced AI features to help reduce the cost.\nLatitude's pricey AI bills underscore an unpleasant truth behind the recent boom in generative AI technologies: The cost to develop and maintain the software can be extraordinarily high, both for the firms that develop the underlying technologies, generally referred to as a large language or foundation models, and those that use the AI to power their own software.\nThe high cost of machine learning is an uncomfortable reality in the industry as VCs eye companies that could potentially be worth trillions and big companies such as Microsoft,\n, and\nuse their considerable capital to develop a lead in the technology that smaller challengers can't catch up to.\nBut if the margin for AI applications is permanently smaller than previous software-as-a-service margins, because of the high cost of computing, it could put a damper on the current boom.\nThe high cost of training and \"inference\" — actually running — large language models is a structural cost that differs from previous computing booms. Even when the software is built, or trained, it still requires a huge amount of computing power to run large language models because they do billions of calculations every time they return a response to a prompt. By comparison, serving web apps or pages requires much less calculation.\nThese calculations also require specialized hardware. While traditional computer processors can run machine learning models, they're slow. Most training and inference now takes place on graphics processors, or GPUs, which were initially intended for 3D gaming, but have become the standard for AI applications because they can do many simple calculations simultaneously.\nNvidia makes most of the GPUs for the AI industry, and its primary data center workhorse chip\n. Scientists that build these models often joke that they \"\n.\"\nAnalysts and technologists estimate that the critical process of training a large language model like GPT-3 could cost over $4 million. More advanced language models could cost over \"the high-single digit-millions\" to train, said Rowan Curran, a Forrester analyst who focuses on AI and machine learning.\nMeta's largest LLaMA model released last month, for example, used 2,048 Nvidia A100 GPUs to train on 1.4 trillion tokens (750 words is about 1,000 tokens), taking about 21 days, the company said when it released the model last month.\nIt took about 1 million GPU hours to train. With\n, it would cost over $2.4 million. And at 65 billion parameters, it's smaller than the current GPT models at OpenAI, like ChatGPT-3, which has 175 billion parameters.\nClement Delangue, the CEO of the AI startup Hugging Face said that the process of training the company's Bloom large language model took over two-and-a-half months and required access to a supercomputer that was \"something like the equivalent of 500 GPUs.\"\nOrganizations that build large language models must be cautious when they retrain the software, which helps the software improve its abilities, because it costs so much, he said.\n\"It's important to realize that these models are not trained all the time, like every day,\" Delangue said, noting that's why some models, like ChatGPT, don't have knowledge of recent events. ChatGPT's knowledge stops in 2021, he said.\n\"We are actually doing a training right now for the version two of Bloom and it's gonna cost no more than $10 million to retrain,\" Delangue said. \"So that's the kind of thing that we don't want to do every week.\"\nTo use a trained machine learning model to make predictions or generate text, engineers use the model in a process called \"inference,\" which can be much more expensive than training because it might need to run millions of times for a popular product.\nFor a product as popular as ChatGPT, which investment firm UBS estimates to have\n100 million monthly active users in January, Curran believes that it could have cost OpenAI $40 million to process the millions of prompts people fed into the software that month.\nCosts skyrocket when these tools are used billions of times a day. Financial analysts estimate Microsoft's Bing AI chatbot, which is powered by an OpenAI ChatGPT model, needs at least\nto serve responses to all Bing users.\nIn the case of Latitude, for instance, while the startup didn't have to pay to train the underlying OpenAI language model it was accessing, it had to account for the inferencing costs that were something akin to \"half-a-cent per call\" on \"a couple million requests per day,\" a Latitude spokesperson said.\n\"And I was being relatively conservative,\" Curran said of his calculations.\nIn order to sow the seeds of the current AI boom, venture capitalists and tech giants have been investing billions of dollars into startups that specialize in generative AI technologies. Microsoft, for instance, invested as much as $10 billion into GPT's overseer OpenAI, according to media\nin January.\n's venture capital arm, Salesforce Ventures, recently debuted a $250 million fund that caters to generative AI startups.\nAs investor Semil Shah of the VC firms Haystack and Lightspeed Venture Partners\non Twitter, \"VC dollars shifted from subsidizing your taxi ride and burrito delivery to LLMs and generative AI compute.\"\nMany entrepreneurs see risks in relying on potentially subsidized AI models that they don't control and merely pay for on a per-use basis.\n\"When I talk to my AI friends at the startup conferences, this is what I tell them: Do not solely depend on OpenAI, ChatGPT or any other large language models,\" said Suman Kanuganti, founder of\n, a chatbot currently in beta mode. \"Because businesses shift, they are all owned by big tech companies, right? If they cut access, you're gone.\"\nCompanies like enterprise tech firm Conversica are exploring how they can use the tech through Microsoft's Azure cloud service at its currently discounted price.\nWhile Conversica CEO Jim Kaskade declined to comment about how much the startup is paying, he conceded that the subsidized cost is welcome as it explores how language models can be used effectively.\n\"If they were truly trying to break even, they'd be charging a hell of a lot more,\" Kaskade said.\nIt's unclear if AI computation will stay expensive as the industry develops. Companies making the foundation models, semiconductor makers, and startups all see business opportunities in reducing the price of running AI software.\nNvidia, which has about 95% of the market for AI chips, continues to develop more powerful versions designed specifically for machine learning, but improvements in total chip power across the industry have slowed in recent years.\nStill, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes that in 10 years, AI will be a million times more efficient because of improvements not only in chips, but also in software and other computer parts.\n\"Moore's Law, in its best days, would have delivered 100x in a decade,\" Huang said last month on an earnings call. \"By coming up with new processors, new systems, new interconnects, new frameworks and algorithms, and working with data scientists, AI researchers on new models, across that entire span, we've made large language model processing a million times faster.\"\nSome startups have focused on the high cost of AI as a business opportunity.\n\"Nobody was saying, you should build something that was purpose-built for inference. What would that look like?\" said Sid Sheth, founder of D-Matrix, a startup building a system to save money on inference by doing more processing in the computer's memory, as opposed to on a GPU.\n\"People are using GPUs today, NVIDIA GPUs, to do most of their inference. They buy the DGX systems that NVIDIA sells that cost a ton of money. The problem with inference is if the workload spikes very rapidly, which is what happened to ChatGPT, it went to like a million users in five days. There is no way your GPU capacity can keep up with that because it was not built for that. It was built for training, for graphics acceleration,\" he said.\nDelangue, the HuggingFace CEO, believes more companies would be better served focusing on smaller, specific models that are cheaper to train and run, instead of the large language models that are garnering most of the attention.\nMeanwhile, OpenAI announced last month that it's lowering the cost for companies to access its GPT models. It now charges\nfor about 750 words of output.\nOpenAI's lower prices have caught the attention of AI Dungeon-maker Latitude.\n\"I think it's fair to say that it's definitely a huge change we're excited to see happen in the industry and we're constantly evaluating how we can deliver the best experience to users,\" a Latitude spokesperson said. \"Latitude is going to continue to evaluate all AI models to be sure we have the best game out there.\"\n:"},

But the picture might be changing, with Rome electing the first female prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, in October.\n\"I remember wondering at the time whether I really wanted my daughter to grow up in that environment,\" Erik Jones, professor at the European University Institute in Florence, told CNBC about the time when Silvio Berlusconi served as Italy's prime minister.\n\"We are very far from that sort of objectification of women today. That is something we should all celebrate, even if there is still more to be done. Giorgia Meloni and Elly Schlein are emblematic of that change,\" he added.\nData from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development showed that female political representation accounts for only 33.8% of its member nations. In Italy, the number is slightly lower at 32.3%.\nMeloni and Schlein hold the top two jobs in Italian politics but they have entirely different political views.\n\"I'm Giorgia, I'm a woman, I'm a mother, I'm a Christian!\" This was one of Meloni's main lines during the campaign in 2022.\nSchlein, in an interview with the New York Times, said she didn't understand how being a woman, a mother and a Christian helps Italians.\n\"I am a woman. I love another woman. I am not a mother, but I am not less of a woman for this,\" Schlein said in the same\n.\nIn previous remarks, Schlein said she wants to tax the rich, work closely with trade unions, push for environmental and feminist policies, and support gay and immigrant rights.\nConservative media in Italy have dubbed her \"\n\" and criticized her \"rich\" upbringing in Switzerland.\nSchlein's team was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC Wednesday.\n\"Meloni has frequently boasted about her being the first female Prime Minister while the left has not been able to produce the same result in a decade-long control of the parliament.

Sales were $84.18 million, down more than 13% from $97.22 million year over year.\nWhile full year net revenue increased by 7% to $297.77 million, Allbirds' net losses in its first full year as a public company ballooned to $101.35 million, more than double the $45.37 million in losses it recorded in 2021.\nGross margins in the quarter decreased to 43.1% compared to 50.2% in the year-earlier period as selling, general and administrative expenses jumped to $41.6 million, compared to $36.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nThe shoemaker said its poor performance can be attributed to a series of missteps, including its decision to shift away from its core consumer by introducing products that deviated form that base, including technical performance running products geared for elite athletes.\nFollowing the successful launch of its Dasher running shoe, the company decided to penetrate deeper into the high-performance category with products like the Flyer. But Allbirds' customers just weren't \"ready for us to serve them in that area,\" Zwillinger told CNBC in an interview Thursday.\n\"As we made those adjacent product development decisions, we unfortunately lost a bit of sight of what our core consumer fell in love with us for in the first place and what they continue to want from us,\" Zwillinger said.\n\"And unfortunately, as you have limited resources, we expended our marketing dollars and our product-development resources on those adjacencies and didn't do as much work on embellishments of the core franchise and revitalizing those franchises to keep them extremely relevant with the core consumer.\"\nThose missteps coupled with a \"very promotional\" holiday season led the company to miss expectations, Zwillinger said.\n\"We just saw those culminating in a way that just came together and put a compound effect and had us miss expectations, which was really disappointing for us,\" he said.\nThe company also made a series of changes to its executive leadership and board of directors.\nChief Financial Officer Mike Bufano will be stepping down. Annie Mitchell, who previously worked at Gymshark and\n, will be taking his place.\nAllbirds also hired a new head of stores for North America, eliminated its chief commercial officer position and appointed former\nexecutive Ann Freeman to its board. Eric Sprunk, the former chief operating officer of Nike, has also been appointed as a board advisor.\nAllbirds outlined several focus areas it plans to drill down on in 2023. It also hired a chief transformation officer — former Juul Labs executive Jared Fix — to lead the charge.\nThe company plans to reconnect with its core consumer by focusing specifically on the products those customers want and offering a more curated seasonal color offering that's gender specific.\nIt will also slow the pace of Allbirds store openings in the United States and continue to partner with wholesalers — such as REI,\nand\n— to enhance brand awareness and boost sales.\nIn 2022, the company opened 19 new stores in the U.S. As of the end of December, Allbirds had 58 total stores, 42 in the U.S. and 16 abroad. In 2023, it plans to open just three new stores in the U.S. in locations for which it signed leases in early 2022.\nThe company is also revisiting its go-to-market strategy in certain international markets and is considering moving toward a distributor model to reduce operating expenses and overall complexity.\nIts final area of focus will be enhancing gross and operating margins by transitioning to a single manufacturing partner in Vietnam.\nRead the full earnings release\n."},

The Covid pandemic and the rise of streaming have fundamentally altered the industry. The result has been a smaller bump in box office at the time of nominations and a significant surge in streaming demand.\nFrom the nominations in late January through Wednesday, this year's 10 best picture nominees added $82 million in domestic box office sales, $71 million of which came from \"Avatar: The Way of Water.\" (\"The Way of Water\" has grossed more than $670 million total in North America.)\nFor comparison, in 2020, the nominees generated around $201 million at the domestic box office after being nominated in mid-January, Comscore data shows. The Oscars were awarded Feb. 9 that year, weeks before Covid was declared a pandemic and shutdowns began.\n\"Many of this year's contenders sprang from earlier on the release calendar and thus were 'played out' in terms of their ability to generate Oscar bonus dollars in cinemas,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.\nIn the past, films like \"1917,\" \"Hidden Figures\" and \"Silver Linings Playbook\" – which were merely nominated for the award – generated 50% or more of their domestic box office revenue after scoring a nod, according to data from Comscore. For 2014's \"American Sniper,\" 99% of its box office ticket sales came after its nomination, a whopping $346 million.\nThis year, all of the best picture nominees saw less than 13% of revenue from post-nomination box office except for one. \"Women Talking,\" one of the smaller films up for the top award, generated 77% of its revenue after the nominations, or around $3.9 million, according to Comscore data.\n\"The Oscars bump is not a new phenomenon,\" said Brandon Katz, an industry strategist at Parrot Analytics. \"For decades, we've seen contenders pick up extra box office ticket sales once the picture nominations were announced. But what has changed more recently, particularly as the Oscars have taken place a month later than usual in recent years and they've been impacted by Covid, is a streaming bump.\"\nParrot Analytics determined that the 10 best picture nominees saw an average audience demand increase of 21% in the week after receiving the coveted nomination. This demand metric is calculated by looking at consumption, including piracy, social media posts and interactions, social video views and online research on sites like IMDb and Wikipedia.\nMuch of that demand likely manifested in streaming. Only six of the 10 best picture nominees posted comparable box office data in the week after the nominations were posted.\n\"The Banshees of Inisherin\" saw the biggest percentage bump between the week before nominations and the weeks after, with ticket sales jumping 381%. However, that represents a jump from $73,000 in box office receipts to $352,000.\nDuring that weekend, fellow nominees \"Everything Everywhere All at Once,\" \"The Fabelmans,\" \"Tar,\" \"Triangle of Sadness\" and \"Women Talking,\" each generated under $1 million in ticket sales despite receiving significant bumps in audience traffic.\nOnly \"Avatar: The Way of Water,\" which saw ticket sales decline 21% during the weekend after the nominations, generated more than $1 million – tallying $15.9 million in domestic receipts.\nThe staggering difference has a lot to do with when these films were released, their availability on streaming platforms and the genres of the films.\nThe blockbuster \"The Way of Water\" was in its sixth week in theaters and carried momentum at the box office, while \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" only just returned to the big screen after a nearly sixth-month hiatus from cinemas.\nNotably, by the time nominations were revealed \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" had already been in the public zeitgeist for almost a full year. The film was released in late March 2022.\nTraditionally, Oscar bait films are released in the last quarter of the year, with the majority hitting cinemas in November and December. For this year's nominees, only three debuted during the last two months of last year.\nIn the past, the Academy Awards ceremony has been hosted in February, so even those films released in October may have still been playing exclusively in theaters had the pandemic not pushed the event into March.\nHowever, this year, at the time of nominations in late January, eight of the 10 films nominated for best picture were available on streaming. But that's not necessarily a bad thing, said Katz.\n\"In the last couple of years everyone has said: movie theaters versus streaming. I never viewed it like that,\" Katz said. \"I don't necessarily think the data supports that. I actually think those two mediums can be additive and complimentary and not oppositional.\"\nKatz noted that some films get a box office increase from the nomination, but the availability of titles on streaming can build buzz and momentum during the later portion of the voting period.\n\"Obviously, it's hard to argue with the dollar sign and box office figures,\" said Wade Payson-Denney, an analyst at Parrot Analytics. \"But that's just one part of the equation nowadays. Streaming plays such a big role.\"\n\"All Quiet on the Western Front\" generated the biggest bump in demand, up 59% in the week after its best picture nomination. The film ran for a limited time in theaters, just long enough to drum up Oscar contention, before transitioning to its home on\n. The fact that the film was only available on streaming is likely why it saw the biggest jump in demand.\nThis also explains why there is no box office data for the film.\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" and \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" the biggest box office smashes of 2022, saw demand drop.\nFor \"Maverick,\" the fall in demand is likely because the film has been out in public since May and been available to stream since late December. \"The Way of Water\" is still in theaters and won't be available to stream until the end of this month. Those that wanted to see these films have had ample time to do so or had so recently seen them, they didn't feel the need to watch them again or pirate them.\n\"Sunday's telecast will serve as a three-hour plus infomercial showcasing the films and performances that are the most notable of the year,\" Dergarabedian said. \"This should translate to an increased desire for viewers to seek out these films at home.\""},

Around 30 train cars came off the tracks Thursday, though there were no reported injuries and no risk of hazardous material associated with the derailment.\n\"You're coming here with three derailments within three months, and the average in the industry is one per month for the entire industry,\" Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., told Shaw during the hearing \"So congratulations on maybe some good luck over a few years, but at this moment, your team is the team that has the most derailments in the last three months.\"\nShaw, for his part, said Norfolk Southern is committed to providing financial assistance to affected residents and first responders in the region. The company has pledged more than $21 million in reimbursements and investments.\nThe CEO appeared alongside Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator Debra Shore, Ohio EPA director Anne Vogel, Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission executive director Richard Harrison, and Beaver County, Pennsylvania, Department of Emergency Services director Eric Brewer.\nAt about 9 p.m. local time on Feb. 3, an eastbound Norfolk Southern freight train with 11 tank cars carrying hazardous materials derailed near Ohio's border with Pennsylvania and subsequently ignited. The chemicals included vinyl chloride, a highly flammable carcinogen, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.\nThe EPA screened about 600 homes in East Palestine and didn't detect vinyl chloride or hydrogen chlorine, Shore said. She said the EPA is currently conducting 24/7 air monitoring at 21 stations throughout the community. Vogel added that the Ohio EPA has installed monitoring wells at the site of the derailment to test for potential groundwater contamination, as well as sentinel wells for long-term sampling of groundwater.\nShore said she expects waste from the site to move as soon as Thursday. The EPA waited a month before starting to order dioxin testing.\n\"We detected very low levels, which very quickly went even down to non-detect. Without those primary indicators, it was a very low probability that dioxins would have been created,\" Shore said. \"They are secondary byproducts of the burning of vinyl chloride, but we were listening to the community and they expressed significant concerns about toxins.\"\nTexas and Michigan officials said they did not know soil and water from the site of the wreck would be transported to their jurisdictions.\n\"Michigan officials, the governor, myself, Sen. Peters, Michigan EPA, were not notified before that happened,\" said Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich. \"That's not acceptable to us.\"\nThe committee's ranking member, Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito from West Virginia, said the issue came down to trust and accountability.\n\"If something like this happens again, God forbid they should also be able to trust the federal government will be quick, deliberate, transparent and clear in their response, and the guilty party parties will be held responsible,\" Capito said.\nThe committee's chairman, Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., said there was miscommunication surrounding first responders who were under the impression that only one car would be vented and burned rather than five, which left some first responders scrambling. Brewer, the Beaver County official, said the decision was \"jaw-dropping.\"\n\"There was not a script for this. There wasn't a binder for me labeled 'Train Wreck,'\" Brewer said.\nThe committee also heard from Ohio Sens. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, and J.D. Vance, a Republican, as well as Sen. Bob Casey, D-Penn., who together\n. The bill aims to enhance safety procedures for trains transporting hazardous materials, establish requirements for wayside defect detectors, increase fines for wrongdoing and create a minimum requirement for two-person crews.\nShaw endorsed parts of the bill by committing to \"the legislative intent to make rail safer.\" Shaw said during the hearing that Norfolk Southern installed its first new wayside detector on Wednesday, though he said there is no indication these detectors were faulty before the East Palestine derailment. Shaw did not address a provision of the bill requiring a minimum of two-person crews on every locomotive.\nShaw refused to say whether Norfolk Southern would commit to ensuring families full compensation for diminished property values when questioned by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass.\nNo fatalities were reported after the East Palestine derailment, though residents and officials have raised concerns. Rail union representatives\nofficials at a meeting last week that rail workers have fallen ill in East Palestine during the site cleanup.\nPressed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist from Vermont, Shaw said \"everything is on the table\" regarding covering health care needs for East Palestine residents. He also did not directly say whether the company would provide sick days for all employees.\nVance expressed frustration at fellow Republicans who have opposed legislation to hold the company accountable, including those who \"think that any public safety enhancements for the rail industry is somehow a violation of the free market.\"\nThe NTSB\non Feb. 23 that pointed to an overheated wheel bearing as a factor in the derailment and fire. At the time, the train was instructed to stop, the bearing's temperature measured 253 degrees hotter than ambient temperatures, above a threshold of 200 degrees hotter at which point temperatures are considered critical, according Norfolk Southern criteria.\nOn Saturday,\nin Ohio, after which residents near Springfield were ordered to shelter in place. The train was not carrying hazardous materials, and no injuries were reported, though there were power outages in the area.\nHours after that derailment,\nindicated that Norfolk Southern was making broad safety adjustments to prevent future incidents. A company spokesman told CNBC the train carrier is now mandating trains over 10,000 feet long use distributed power, such that trains are powered from several locations across their length.\nThe Norfolk Southern incidents have spurred wide-sweeping reviews by government agencies. On Tuesday, the NTSB said it had opened a\ninto the company's organization and safety culture following the derailments. Separately, the Federal Railroad Administration announced it would conduct a 60-day supplement safety assessment of the company.\n\"We see what the company did with their massive profits. Norfolk Southern spent $3.4 billion on stock buybacks last year and are planning to do even more this year,\" Brown said Thursday. \"That's money that could have gone to hiring inspectors to put in more hot box detectors along its rail lines and having more workers available to repair cars and repair tracks.\"\nThe company has cut around 40% of its workforce since 2015, but Shaw said the company is now \"aggressively hiring employees.\"\nOn Wednesday, Norfolk Southern announced it will create a new regional training center in Ohio for first responders, as well as expand its Operation Awareness and Response program, which educates first responders on safely responding to rail incidents. Training classes will begin on March 22 at Norfolk Southern's Bellevue, Ohio, yard."},
