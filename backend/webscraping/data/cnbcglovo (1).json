    "headline": "Why you won't see many car ads during Sunday's Super Bowl",
    "content": "Automakers  historically among the largest Super Bowl advertisers  are mostly bypassing this Sunday's NFL championship game to preserve cash or spend ad dollars elsewhere. The only automakers expected to advertise during Sunday's game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs on Fox are General Motors, Kia and Stellantis' Ram and Jeep brands. Porsche said it will air a spot shortly before the game in collaboration with Paramount. The broad resistance is a swift change from a year ago, when the automotive industry represented the largest segment for Super Bowl ads, at $99.3 million, according to Kantar Media's Vivvix. That total was up by more than $30 million from 2021 when web-based, media and movie companies outspent the industry. The decline in automotive ads this year comes as companies invest billions of dollars in electric vehicles or attempt to preserve cash in preparation for a potential economic downturn. They also are continuing to battle through supply chain problems. The average cost of a 30-second commercial during last year's Super Bowl was $6.5 million, up more than $2 million over 2016 rates. That cost is now approaching $7 million, according to Kantar Media. \"This has less to do with the Super Bowl itself and more to do with individual issues within the automotive industry,\" Eric Haggstrom, director of business intelligence for Advertiser Perceptions, told CNBC. \"The auto industry has been battered by supply chain issues, inflation eating into consumer budgets, and rising interestrates that have made car payments dramatically more expensive.\"Haggstrom noted several automakers pulled back ad spending in recent years  the result of fewer products to sell due to tight inventories caused by supply chain problems during the coronavirus pandemic. Newer automakers have also traditionally advertised less, or not at all, as they attempt to emulate Tesla's advertising-free model, Haggstrom said. Eight auto brands or companies advertised during last year's Super Bowl, including returning companies GM and Kia. Embattled car retailers Carvana and Vroom, which advertised during last year's game amid record used vehicle demand, are not returning. And EV startup Polestar, whose ad was a success in the 2022 Super Bowl, said it will also not advertise this year. For the 10th consecutive year, auto accessory company WeatherTech will air a 30-second ad. The Illinois-based company is the longest-running automotive business to consecutively advertise during the big game. Those who are advertising say they are taking the opportunity to reach a captive audience that's expected to be around 100 million viewers. The game is historically one of the most-watched events of the year, offering advertisers an opportunity to capitalize on viewership amid declining television audiences. GM's 60-second ad stars actor and comedian Will Ferrell driving GM EVs through popular Netflix shows and movies to promote the streaming service upcoming efforts to include more EVs in its productions. \"It is a big moment,\" GM marketing chief Deborah Wahl told reporters during a briefing about its ad. \"To do something like this is really different.\" Ferrell also appeared in GM's Super Bowl ad promoting EVs two years ago. Those who aren't returning largely attributed the decision to business priorities or available products and capital. Toyota Motor, one of the top Super Bowl advertisers in recent years, said its product plans didn't align with this year's game. \"We look at the Super Bowl very strategically, and we want to make sure that we have a purpose for being in the Super Bowl,\" Lisa Materazzo, group vice president of Toyota Marketing, told CNBC at an event this week for the Chicago Auto Show. \"We definitely think the Super Bowl has a place. This year it just wasn't the right time or place for us.\" Hyundai Motor, in an emailed statement, said the decision not to advertise was \"based on business priorities and where we felt it was best to allocate our marketing resources.\" Audi, which last advertised in 2020, said it's \"focusing on other efforts within our electrification and sustainability commitments.\" Stellantis, formerly known as Fiat Chrysler, has been one of the most prolific advertisers for more than a decade and is returning after a one-year hiatus. The company's chief marketing officer, Olivier Francois, is well known for attracting standout talent including Bruce Springsteen, Bill Murray, Clint Eastwood and Eminem. Stellantis has not released its ads, while GM, Kia and WeatherTech released their commercials earlier this week. Kia's 60-second \"Binky Dad\" ad features a father going viral for racing to retrieve a \"binky\" for his baby, driving a 2023 Telluride X-Pro SUV. It's set to \"Gonna Fly Now\" of 1976, famously known as the \"Rocky\" movie theme music. Uniquely, the commercial features three alternate endings that will be available exclusively on TikTok. The ad has drawn some criticism online, as Kia and its parent company Hyundaihave come under fire for at least four of itssuppliers reportedly violating child labor laws. Both Hyundai and Kia have condemned such practices. Reuters this week reported the parent company is in talks with the U.S. Department of Labor to resolve concerns about child workers in its U.S. supply chain. The 30-second ad for WeatherTech promotes the company's U.S.-made products, showing bank executives and others criticizing the company for its American investments and production. The ad for Porsche is a collaboration with Paramount for this summer's \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" film. It is the second year for such a tie-up following a commercial last year for \"Top Gun: Maverick.\" Haggstrom said there's been a general \"cautiousness\" in the auto industry around advertising. \"They're really looking at what is the value of advertising today? How does that affect my top line, how does that affect my go-to-market,\" he said. \"We've seen a general trend in accountability in consumer advertising.\"  CNBC's John Rosevear contributed to this report."

    "topic": "business",
    "headline": "Here's what's happening with home prices as mortgage rates fall",
    "content": "The U.S. housing market cooled off pretty dramatically last year, after mortgage rates more than doubled from historic lows. Home prices, however, have been stickier.  Prices began falling last June, but are still higher than they were a year ago. Now, as demand appears to be coming back into the market, due to a slight drop in mortgage rates, prices are pushing back. In December, the latest read, U.S. home prices were 6.9% higher year over year, according to CoreLogic. That was the lowest annual appreciation rate since the late summer of 2020. Last April, annual price appreciation hit a high of 20%. Falling home prices were reflecting weaker housing demand, as inflation, job cuts and uncertainty in the economy piled onto the barrier put up by higher mortgage rates. But mortgage rates began to fall in December, and prices reacted immediately. The cooling continued, but not as much as in the months before. \"While prices continued to fall from November, the rate of decline was lower than that seen in the summer and still adds up to only a 3% cumulative drop in prices since last spring's peak,\" said Selma Hepp, chief economist at CoreLogic.Hepp notes that some of the exurban areas that became popular during the first years of the pandemic and saw prices rise sharply are now seeing larger corrections. But she doesn't expect that will last long. \"While price deceleration will likely persist into the spring of 2023, when the market will probably see some year-over-year declines, the recent decrease in mortgage rates has stimulated buyer demand and could result in a more optimistic homebuying season than many expected,\" Hepp said. A monthly survey of homebuying sentiment from Fannie Mae showed an increase in January for the third straight month. Consumers surveyed said they still expected to see prices either fall or flatten over the next year, but the share of those who think it's a good time to sell a home increased to 59% from 51%.More inventory on the market would help bring more buyers back into the market. Anecdotally, real estate agents are reporting an earlier-than-usual surge in the spring market, with open houses seeing more foot traffic in the last few weeks. Some also reported the return of bidding wars. The nation's homebuilders are also reporting increased demand. Homebuilder sentiment in January rose for the first time in 12 months, the National Association of Home Builders said. Builders reported increases in current sales, buyer traffic and sales expectations over the next six months. Lower mortgage rates are driving the new demand. \"With mortgage rates anticipated to continue to trend lower later this year, affordability conditions are expected to improve, and this will increase demand and bring more buyers back into the market,\" said NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz. The NAHB's home affordability index started this year at the lowest level since it began tracking the metric a decade ago. But lower rates are starting to turn that around. If home prices continue to decline at the average rate they have over the past six months, annual home price growth could finally go negative sometime within the next three months, according to a new report from Black Knight. It now takes nearly $600 (+41%) more to make the monthly mortgage payment on the average priced home using a 20% down 30-year rate mortgage than at the same time last year. Mortgage applications to purchase a home, the most current indicator of demand, rose throughout January and the first week of February, although it is still lower than the same period a year ago, when rates were nearly half what they are now. \"We can see definite signs of a January uptick in purchase lending on lower rates and somewhat lower home prices,\" said Ben Graboske, president of Black Knight Data and Analytics. \"But affordability still has a stranglehold on much of the market.\""

    "topic": "business",
    "headline": "Vita Coco wants its coconut water to be your cocktail mixer \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and your hangover cure ",
    "content": "For nearly two decades, Vita Coco has sold its coconut water to health-conscious consumers as a fresh way to hydrate. This year, it's changing the pitch. The beverage company is pushing its namesake brand into new use cases and occasions, partnering with Diageo on a canned cocktail and marketing the drink as a hangover aid. Co-founder Mike Kirban compared Vita Coco's transformation to that of Ocean Spray, the agricultural cooperative that sells cranberry products. \"Ocean Spray is a brand that's four times our size, that's all based on one ingredient,\" the company's executive chairman told CNBC. \"And we should be bigger than Ocean Spray pretty quickly, because I think the coconut is cooler than the cranberry.\" Founded in 2004, Vita Coco started as a coconut water brand but has since expanded into other beverage categories, like energy drinks and water. Its namesake brand still accounts for three-quarters of the company's revenue, which reached $335.8 million in the first nine months of 2022. The company went public in October 2021, just before the market for initial public offerings dried up as inflation, the war in Ukraine and economic uncertainty weighed on investors. Vita Coco's stock is up less than 1% since its IPO, but it's fared better than many other consumer companies that went public around the same time, like Sweetgreen and Allbirds. In May, Kirban transitioned from co-CEO at the company to his current role, leaving Boston Beer veteran Martin Roper as the sole chief executive  another step of Vita Coco's evolution.Just months before Vita Coco's IPO, both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo exited coconut water. Coke sold Zico back to its founder as it slimmed down its portfolio, and Pepsi offloaded O.N.E. as part of the $3.3 billion sale of its juice business. Despite the beverage giants' size, they had been unable to compete with Vita Coco, which is credited with bringing coconut water to the U.S. and still holds 50% share of the market, excluding its private-label business. Their exits from the segment opened a new distribution avenue for Vita Coca. As long as Coke and Pepsi were in the coconut water business, their contracts with venues ranging from stadiums to college campuses shut Vita Coco out. With the momentum of new growth opportunities, Vita Coco is now pushing into bars and restaurants. Step one of the plan is teaming up with Diageo for three canned cocktails mixing Captain Morgan rum and Vita Coco coconut water: a mojito, a pia colada and a strawberry daiquiri. \"If you go to Brazil or Southeast Asia, coconut water is what you mix with cocktails,\" Kirban said. \"The idea is to start getting consumers used to drinking coconut water cocktails with the ready to drink with Diageo partnership.\" Kirban said Vita Coco would be partnering with a spirits company for its broader on-premise expansion plans, but declined to name the partner. Over the last few years, alcohol and nonalcoholic beverage companies have been teaming up, leaning on each others' brand equity and expertise to gain so-called \"share of throat.\" For example, Captain Morgan can introduce itself to Vita Coco's health-conscious, younger consumers, while Vita Coco benefits from the rum's mass market appeal.Vita Coco has also been leaning into its reputation as a hangover \"cure.\" Since late 2019, the brand has used New Year's Day as way to pitch hangover recovery kits and subscriptions that feature its products in collaborations with Postmates, Lyft and Reef Kitchens. This year it's partnering with DoorDash for a promotion Monday morning following the Super Bowl. The marketing strategy is something of a reversal, after years of resisting the association. \"With our board, there was always a discussion,\" Kirban said. \"When you talk marketing, do we want to talk about hangovers? Is that OK for us to talk about?\" And it's not done there. After the hangover subsides, Vita Coco wants to be the non-dairy milk in your coffee. In late January, the brand announced it's partnered with Alfred Coffee, a high-end chain with locations in California and Texas, to create a non-dairy coconut milk for its baristas to use. Vita Coco plans to expand the product designed specifically for coffee  separate from the coconut milk it sells in supermarkets nationwide  to other coffee shops and eventually to store shelves."

    "topic": "business",
    "headline": "Disney CEO Bob Iger's potential willingness to sell Hulu is a reversal in strategy",
    "content": "Disney CEO Bob Iger's apparent openness to selling Hulu marks a stark reversal in strategy for the company  and an even more surprising shift if Iger sells the streaming service to Comcast. Iger said Thursday in an exclusive CNBC interview with David Faber that \"everything is on the table\" with regard to Hulu's future. \"We are intent on reducing our debt,\" Iger said. \"I've talked about general entertainment being undifferentiated. I'm not going to speculate if we're a buyer or a seller of it. But I'm concerned about undifferentiated general entertainment. We're going to look at it very objectively.\" Disney currently owns 66% of Hulu, with Comcast owning the rest. The two companies struck a deal in 2019 in which Comcast can force Disney to buy (or Disney can require Comcast to sell) the remaining 33% in January 2024 at a guaranteed minimum total equity value of $27.5 billion, or about $9.2 billion for the stake. Just five months ago, then-Disney CEO Bob Chapek said hed like to own all of Hulu \"tomorrow\" if he could. Chapek's strategy revolved around eventually tying Hulu together with Disney+ to give consumers a \"hard bundle\" option in which viewers could watch programming from both the family friendly Disney+ and the adult-focused Hulu. Comcast's stake in Hulu prevented Disney from moving forward with his plans. \"I would like nothing more than to come up with that solution for an early agreement,\" Chapek said in a September interview with CNBC. \"But that takes two parties to come up with something that is mutually agreeable.\"Chapek held a conversation in 2021 with Comcast CEO Brian Roberts to try to escalate the sale of Hulu, according to people familiar with the matter. Roberts floated a number of possible ideas, including Disney selling ESPN to Comcast, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. No substantive conversations have occurred since, the people said. Despite the shrinking pay-TV subscriber base, ESPN and many cable networks still rake in a lot of profit, something Disney wasn't willing to give up, especially as it helps to fund the streaming business, the people said. Iger said this week that while a spinout was considered in his absence, it was concluded ESPN should stay with Disney. He said discussions about a sale were not taking place. Another proposition floated to Disney was to have Comcast buy out Hulu. Comcast executives believe Hulu could supercharge its streaming efforts beyond Peacock, the company's flagship streaming service, according to people familiar with the matter. They remain open to a variety of possibilities with Hulu, the people said. Peacock has about 20 million paying subscribers. Hulu has about 48 million subscribers. Both services are only available in the U.S. and U.S. territories. Spokespeople for Comcast and Disney declined to comment. Comcast executives walked away from those discussions resigned to taking Disney's money in 2024 rather than gaining full ownership of Hulu, as CNBC reported in September.Those circumstances may have shifted with Iger's return. It's possible Iger's comments Thursday were just posturing. Threatening to be a seller of Hulu rather than a buyer may lower the price of the streaming asset, which would behoove Disney if it were to actually buy the 33% stake from Comcast. Iger has previously championed Hulu as part of Disney's strategy to offer three relatively low-priced services (Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+) rather than one mega-product that would likely be the most expensive streaming service. His thinking had been that giving subscribers too much content in one product may lead to what happened with cable TV  consumers begin feeling they're paying too much money for content they're not watching. Selling Hulu would unwind this strategy, and it also may lead to cancellations of Disney+ and ESPN+. Disney has pushed its bundle of the three services for $12.99 per month (with ads). That's about a 50% discount to buying the three services separately, which would cost nearly $26. Still, publicly acknowledging Disney could be open to selling Hulu is a bold move. It puts Hulu employees on high alert and adds uncertainty to Iger's own company. Iger's comments may also be meant to draw a reaction from shareholders.Iger's Hulu commentary also challenges one of his long-held edicts: don't strengthen Comcast at Disney's behest. When Iger acquired the majority of Fox's assets for $71 billion in 2019, one of his primary motivating factors was to make sure Comcast didn't acquire a majority stake in Hulu. Activist investor Nelson Peltz, who Thursday dropped his proxy fight to get a Disney board seat, had been arguing that Iger dramatically overpaid for Fox. Iger's defense of that deal was passing on it would have strengthened Comcast and weakened Disney in the streaming wars, according to people familiar with his thinking. Competitive tension between Comcast and Disney isn't new. Roberts made a hostile bid to acquire Disney for $54 billion in 2004. Previous NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke left Disney to come work for Roberts in 1998. In a streaming environment, Disney's products take eyeballs and subscription revenue away from Peacock, and vice versa. Still, Iger and Roberts have a strong working relationship, according to people familiar with the matter. Iger even spoke at an internal NBCUniversal event last year. Both companies will need to work closely together to agree on any conclusion for Hulu. Even if Disney buys the remaining stake of Hulu, the sides must agree on fair market value. Iger's comments Thursday may be the starting gun on what could be months of negotiations to follow.Disclosure: Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC."

    "headline": "Alec Baldwin attorneys seek to reduce possible penalty in Rust movie set manslaughter case",
    "content": "Alec Baldwin's attorneys filed a motion Friday arguing New Mexico prosecutors have wrongly charged the actor under a statue that doesn't apply to his case  and which carries a mandatory five-year jail sentence. Baldwin was charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter late last month for the Oct. 2021 fatal on-set shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, one of which is more serious and includes a firearm enhancement that would carry the mandatory jail sentence. If the case ends up going to trial, jurors would have to decide which involuntary manslaughter charge Baldwin is guilty of, if either. In a motion filed in Santa Fe's First Judicial District, Baldwin's attorneys argue that specific enhancement doesn't apply to Baldwin because the statute was changed in May 2022, seven months after the incident. \"The prosecutors in this case have committed an unconstitutional and elementary legal error by charging Mr. Baldwin under a statute that did not exist on the date of the accident,\" Baldwin's attorneys wrote in the motion. At the time of the incident, New Mexico's firearm-enhancement statute was applied to cases where a gun was \"brandished\" in the commission of a non-capital felony, defining brandished as displaying a firearm \"with intent to intimidate or injure a person.\" The statute was later amended by the New Mexico legislature to remove any mention that a gun must be brandished, the court filing states. Baldwin's attorneys argue the new version of the statute cannot apply to conduct that occurred before it was enacted and called retroactively applying the enhancement \"flagrantly unconstitutional.\" \"The government's statement of probable cause contains no allegation that Mr. Baldwin acted 'with intent to intimidate or injure a person,' and its description of the alleged conduct makes clear that the tragic death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was an accident,\" the filing states. \"Application of the current version of the statute would be unconstitutionally retroactive, and the government has no legitimate basis to charge Mr. Baldwin under the version of the statute that existed at the time of the accident.\" In response, Heather Brewer, the spokesperson for the New Mexico First Judicial District Attorney, said the motion was nothing but an attempt to distract \"from the gross negligence and complete disregard for safety on the 'Rust' film set that led to Halyna Hutchins' death.\" \"In accordance with good legal practice, the District Attorney and the special prosecutor will review all motions--even those given to the media before being served to the DA,\" said Brewer. \"However, the DA's and the special prosecutor's focus will always remain on ensuring that justice is served and that everyone--even celebrities with fancy attorneys--is held accountable under the law.\""

    "content": "Chick-fil-A will test its first plant-based entree: a cauliflower sandwich. The new sandwich closely resembles its famous chicken sandwich, but uses breaded and pressure-cooked cauliflower in place of meat. Starting Monday, the privately owned chain, which is the third-largest in the U.S. by sales, will test the menu item in Denver; Charleston, South Carolina; and the Greensboro-Triad region of North Carolina. Chick-fil-A said it's been working on a plant-based sandwich for nearly four years, right around when chains like Dunkin' and Restaurant Brands International's Burger King were putting Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods substitutes on their menus.  But meat alternatives that closely resemble the real thing have fallen out of favor with consumers after a surge in popularity during pandemic lockdowns. Both Beyond and Impossible have recently laid off about a fifth of their workforces. \"We explored every corner of the plant-based space in search of the perfect centerpiece for our plant-forward entre,\" Chick-fil-A Culinary Lead Stuart Tracy said in a statement. \"Time and time again, we kept returning to cauliflower as the base of our sandwich.\" Over the last decade, cauliflower has become a popular substitute for a plethora of different foods. Buffalo Wild Wings and countless bars serve fried cauliflower smothered in buffalo sauce as an alternative to chicken wings. Cauliflower has also popped up in pretzel form and  when finely chopped  as a rice substitute."

    "content": "Google employees are criticizing leadership, most notably CEO Sundar Pichai, for the way the company handled the announcement this week of its ChatGPT competitor called Bard. Staffers took to the popular internal forum Memegen to express their thoughts on the Bard announcement, referring to it as \"rushed,\" \"botched\" and \"un-Googley,\" according to messages and memes viewed by CNBC. On Monday, Google got ahead of a Microsoft event the following day and had Pichai publicly divulge some details of the company's chatbot technology. More about Bard was revealed on Wednesday at an event held in Paris. In between those events, Microsoft, an early investor in ChatGPT creator OpenAI, showcased how its Bing search engine will integrate with the buzzy chat technology, inviting reporters to a demonstration at the company's headquarters in Redmond, Washington.During Google's Wednesday event, search boss Prabhakar Raghavan briefly shared some slides with examples of Bards capabilities. People tuning in expected to hear more, and some employees werent even aware of the event. One presenter forgot to bring a phone that was required for the demo. Meanwhile, people on Twitter began pointing out that an ad for Bard offered an incorrect description of a telescope used to take the first pictures of a planet outside our solar system. While Google employees often turn to Memegen to humorously poke fun at the company's quirks and missteps, the posts after the Bard announcement struck a more serious tone and even went directly after Pichai. Dear Sundar, the Bard launch and the layoffs were rushed, botched, and myopic, read one meme that included a serious picture of Pichai. Please return to taking a long-term outlook. The post received many upvotes from employees. A Google representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sundar, and leadership, deserve a Perf NI, another highly rated meme read, referring to the lowest category in the company's employee performance review system.They are being comically short sighted and un-Googlely in their pursuit of sharpening focus.'\"Last year, Pichai called on employees to be more focused. Leadership often implores staffers to be \"Googley,\" which loosely means being ambitious and hardworking, with respect and teamwork in mind. Alphabet shares have tumbled more than 9% this week on concerns about ChatGPT's threat to Google's core search business and to the company's hastened reaction to Microsoft's event. Rushing Bard to market in a panic validated the markets fear about us, one highly rated meme read. The attached photo was of a bird doing a facepalm. Google's position in artificial intelligence is a familiar concern. At a December all-hands meeting, employees asked about the companys competitive edge in AI as ChatGPT was taking off in the public eye. Executives responded by saying the companys reputation could suffer if it moves too fast on AI-chat technology, which is far from perfect. A highly read meme this week showed an image of a dumpster fire with the Google \"G\" logo on it. The text said, How everythings felt since last year. Another meme referred to last month's announced layoffs, which resulted in the loss of 12,000 jobs, or 6% of the company's workforce. The meme featured a photo of actor Nicolas Cage smiling and said Firing 12k people rises the stock by 3%, one rushed AI presentation drops it by 8%."

    "headline": "Amazon is the latest threat to Facebook as ad targeting suffers",
    "content": "For Matthew Hassett's smart alarm clock company Loftie, the 2022 holiday shopping rush was the busiest in its five-year history despite a lackluster U.S. economy and persistent concerns of a recession. Hassett, who's based in New York, attributes the boon to one key decision. He reallocated his marketing budget, decreasing spending on Facebook and, for the first time during a holiday season, committing ad dollars to Amazon. \"So many people start their shopping on Amazon,\" Hassett said in an interview. \"I do personally for most things. So, we have to be there.\" Loftie is representative of a larger trend taking place in retail that's having major ripples on Madison Avenue and Wall Street. Amazon's increased advertising offerings for the millions of brands that sell on the site coupled with Facebook's diminished targeting capabilities that resulted from Apple's privacy changes have produced a significant realignment in the digital ad market. Until a year ago, Amazon didn't even disclose the size of its advertising business, leaving analysts and investors to guess how much the company was making in allowing sellers and brands to promote their wares on the site and apps. Now, the company's ad division is a $38 billion annual business, and last week reported 19% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter to $11.6 billion. Facebook parent Meta, meanwhile reported a 4% annual decline in revenue for the quarter to $32.2 billion, shrinking for a third consecutive period. Google has been less impacted by Apple's iOS update, but the ad business is still being hit by the economic slowdown. Parent company Alphabet posted revenue growth of 1% to $76 billion.Amazon has catapulted to third in the global digital ad market, with 7.3% share, according to Insider Intelligence. Even as it takes share from Google and Facebook, it's still well behind the two market leaders, which control 28.8% and 20.5%, respectively, of the industry. The Facebook figure includes Instagram. Loftie continues to spend more money on Facebook than Amazon, but the equation has changed dramatically. In the days surrounding Black Friday in November, he allocated 10% of his marketing budget to Amazon, up from zero the year before. Facebook and Instagram fell to 40% of his budget from 71%. The rest of the money he pulled out of Meta went to Google, as he increased spending there from 29% over the holidays in 2021 to 50% last year. Hassett said Facebook ads simply don't work as well anymore, after the iOS update in 2021 began forcing app developers to ask users if they wanted to be tracked. With more consumers opting out of app tracking, the pool of potential customers has been \"hollowed out and so we can no longer reliably target people,\" Hassett said. \"Facebook has to serve the audience to a bigger pool of people in order to find the same people you're finding before, and that's just more expensive,\" he said. \"You have to pay a lot more than you did a year ago, and a lot of that is due to Apple's privacy changes.\" Meta's finance chief, Susan Li, told analysts on last week's earnings call that growth in the company's biggest verticals, online commerce and consumer packaged goods, \"remained negative\" in the quarter. She said the pace of the year-to-year decline in \"online commerce has slowed compared to last quarter,\" but was uncertain if the sector will significantly rebound anytime soon.For Loftie, Amazon and Google provide better value because a shopper is showing intent by searching for a particular item. Hassett purchased keywords like \"white noise\" as well as \"Loftie\" to make sure that consumers who wanted to find his products weren't misdirected. \"The work we do off of Amazon on advertising definitely pays dividends on Amazon because people are going there and typing in Loftie,\" Hassett said, adding that his shift in ad spending helped Loftie generate a record $250,000 in revenue over a four-day stretch during the holidays. Investment bank Cowen noted in a recent survey of ad buyers that \"Amazon was the most popular survey response when we asked respondents which ad platform outside of GOOG / FB properties could emerge or is emerging as a meaningful part of buyers' Digital ad spend, ahead of TikTok.\" The survey indicated that there continues to be \"broad interest among advertisers\" to grow their Amazon budgets in 2023, with 54% of surveyed Amazon advertisers saying they are planning to spend more this year than last. While Facebook remains a core piece of a brand's budget, its influence is diminishing, and the company's investment in its TikTok-like Reels product will take a few years to make a significant financial impact, the Cowen analysts said. \"In the near term, we expect Meta ad share to decline further in '23 given macro headwinds and the pivot to Reels,\" they wrote. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment for this story but sent CNBC examples of brands that the company says increased their allocation to Facebook and Instagram and have seen improved performance from ads on the site. Like Loftie, Robin Golf also had to move away from Facebook in promoting its catalog of golf clubs and related equipment. CEO Peter Marler said over the past year more of that money has gone to Amazon. Between July 2021 and the same month a year later, Robin's cost to acquire a customer jumped 260% to $180 from $50, Marler said. He attributed most of the surge in costs to Facebook's reduced targeting abilities, and said Google also wasn't performing as well. \"We started investing more heavily in Amazon,\" Marler said. \"We shifted budget away from Facebook, we shifted budget away from Google, and we shifted to Amazon, and our Amazon sales have shot up by about 600% in 2022.\" Overall, the value of the tracking cookie has withered because of a renewed emphasis on consumer privacy. There are very few major online ad platforms that don't rely on targeting, Marler said. \"Changes in the efficacy of those platforms really have forced us to reexamine our reliance on them,\" he said. \"We are actively moving our budgets away and decreasing the amount of money that we are spending with Meta.\"Reliance on Amazon has its own pitfalls. The company is a dominant force in online retail and can make or break a brand's success based on its performance on the site. That's particularly risky because Amazon has its own ballooning private-label business, which regularly rolls out products that compete with sellers on the platform. Vitamin company Manna Health has been increasing its presence on Amazon, committing more of its ad budget to the site since the iOS changes, with plans to possibly double its allocation in 2023 from less than 10% currently, said marketing chief Ryan Farmer.But he worries about brand loyalty, when so many transactions take place on Amazon. \"It's not our customer, it's Amazon's customer,\" Farmer said. Farmer likens Amazon's online ad system to Google's in that companies run ads based on keywords that they think resonate with potential customers who may be searching for certain products. Manna also uses Amazon's demand-side platform advertising tool, which is helpful for placement in banner ads that can be seen by people \"searching for certain things,\" Farmer said. Manna, like Loftie and Robin Golf, maintains a customized Amazon homepage that contains graphics, slogans, and a listing of the company's various products that it's selling on Amazon. However, the system is a \"black box,\" Famer said, because it doesn't provide the kind of demographic data or other information to help Manna retain and nurture its customers. Manna doesn't even get contact information for the buyer. CEO Jeff Hill said he wished that Amazon offered \"more insight into the customer, obviously, and sharing emails would be a bare minimum\" so Manna could build a community and talk to clients. \"'Hey, you bought this joint supplement, you know you might also be interested in our new bone supplement,\" Hill said, describing a potential follow-up email. \"It would help our company out and we would be able to buy more on Amazon and it would be mutually beneficial for us to make it to the customer and drive more traffic back to Amazon and the products.\" Amazon declined to provide a comment for this story. Rachel Tipograph, CEO of marketing technology firm MikMak, said there are other unforeseen costs tied to Amazon advertising. Unlike Meta, which just requires you to log in to Facebook's business manager to start buying ads, advertising on Amazon comes alongside listing products on the platform and a host of other services that brands are often buying, including warehouse space. Premium ad placement is the equivalent of slotting fees in retail stores, where brands pay for shelf visibility.Tipograph expects these costs will \"cause the pendulum to swing back\" toward brand promotion, and companies will rely more on channels that direct traffic to their own website and give them more control over their expenses. \"What CFOs want is profitable advertising, profitable growth,\" Tipograph said, \"and they want to know that they are driving incremental growth.\" Ryan Flannagan, CEO of e-commerce marketing firm Nuanced Media, said that as Amazon's ad business has grown, so has the competition to run \"premium copy and visuals.\" Companies that aren't investing in Amazon ads are \"basically losing market share, because they're not defending themselves,\" Flanagan said. Amazon has plenty of work ahead to keep its ad offerings attractive enough for brands to continue forking over bigger portions of their budget. But for now, companies like Loftie are happy with the returns they're getting from Amazon, given the challenges with Facebook. The way Hassett sees it, even with the rising expenses and associated risks, Amazon is providing enough value to justify the headaches. \"I think you have to be there,\" he said."

    "headline": "Crypto markets are undergoing a 'flight to quality,' says Goldman Sachs digital assets chief ",
    "content": "Last year's havoc in the cryptocurrencies space has allowed for a \"flight to quality\" among crypto investors, Mathew McDermott, Goldman Sachs' global head of digital assets, said on CNBC's \"Crypto World\" on Friday. We do have a crypto trading desk at the firm,\" he said, noting that the bank only trades cash-settled derivatives, options and futures. Cryptocurrencies suffered during 2022 as investors steered clear of risk assets. Bitcoin tanked more than 60% last year. The collapse of crypto exchange FTX, along with a washout among other crypto-related companies, also raised concerns on whether federal agencies need to step in and regulate the industry. Since then, large investors who continue to participate in the space have become more discerning. \"What weve seen more of our larger clients eager to onboard and trade with what they probably perceive to be much better regulated and capitalized entities,\" McDermott added, noting that this has been a byproduct of last year.Speaking with CNBC's \"Crypto World,\" McDermott pointed to the bank's three key areas of focus in crypto: tokenization, remaking the plumbing of financial markets and the \"profound\" effect that digital money will have across markets. \"The excitement from our side is  seeing how this technology can impact many different parts of the financial system and have a real commercial impact,\" he added.\"We're at such an early stage in terms of its adoption, but as you look across the marketplace and you see the breadth of financial institutions building out their digital asset teams, their digital asset strategies, be that the sell side or the buy side, it's just super exciting and I think there's a real recognition there.\" Collaborating with two other banks, Goldman Sachs launched a tokenization platform that processed a $100 million dollar eurobond from the European Investment Bank. \"One of the things from my perspective that's kind of been quite important is really demonstrating that we can apply the technology across all the geographies,\" McDermott said.\"We've done something in Europe and as we continue to build out, we're very eager to do that more broadly across the globe.\" CNBC was first to report in November that Goldman Sachs also collaborated with crypto data firm Coin Metrics and financial firm MSCI to create a new classification system called Datonomy, which McDermott said essentially provides a framework for investment into the new asset class. \"This we felt was a really important kind of feature for the market,\" McDermott said, describing Datonomy. \"We wanted to provide something to the clients that gave them the tools to kind of better analyze, and particularly those who are looking to kind of think about investing, just give them that skill set, or certainly the details to enable them to do it in a more intelligent way,\" he said.FTX's collapse in late 2022 and the domino effect that wiped out other crypto companies, contributed to traditional financial institutions, like Goldman, being presented with \"more sensible\" valuations for potential investment in the technology that underpins crypto, according to McDermott. \"There's been this precipitous fall in the valuation of many companies related to the crypto marketplace,\" McDermott said. \"But really the area that we've been focused on, blockchain infrastructure, we've continued to see some really interesting opportunities in businesses that are well managed.\"  McDermott noted that Goldman Sachs has made investments in the digital asset space, predominantly focusing on blockchain infrastructure and that the bank is \"seeing some interesting opportunities there of valuations that just look much more sensible.\" Goldman Sachs has 11 crypto businesses in its portfolio, including Coin Metrics, infrastructure firm Blockdaemon and the bank's most recent investment TRM Labs."

    "headline": "Bill Gates: Nuclear waste is not a reason to avoid nuclear energy",
    "content": "Nuclear waste is not a reason to avoid using nuclear energy, according to Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist who more recently founded a next-generation nuclear energy startup, TerraPower. One common criticism of nuclear power is that nuclear reactors generate waste that stays radioactive for thousands of years. \"The waste problems should not be a reason to not do nuclear,\" Gates said in an interview with the German business publication Handelsblatt, published on Thursday. \"The amount of waste involved, the ability to do geological sequestration  that's not a reason not to do nuclear.\" The volume of nuclear waste is very small, especially when compared with the energy generated, Gates said. \"Say the U.S. was completely nuclear-powered  it's a few rooms worth of total waste. So not, it's not a gigantic thing,\" Gates said. The cost of storing and sequestering nuclear waste underground is \"not a huge problem,\" as it can be put into deep boreholes underground \"where it stays geologically for hundreds of millions of years,\" he said.In contrast, the amount of carbon dioxide emissions generated from burning fossil fuels for energy is \"something gigantic\" and sequestering that underground is a very hard problem, which Gates said \"may not be possible.\" Nuclear power is classified as a \"zero-emission clean energy source\" by the U.S. Department of Energy, because generating electricity with nuclear fission does not release any greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, 19% of electricity generated in the United States comes from nuclear power plants, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That represents about half of the carbon-free electricity generation in the U.S., according to the U.S. Department of Energy. But after a boom of nuclear power reactor construction in the 1970s and 1980s, the construction of new nuclear power generation came to a virtual standstill. \"The best hope for nuclear is if we could get a completely new generation  and I'm biased, because I'm involved in that  where the countries that are committed to nuclear prove it out and show that the economic safety, waste management is handled,\" Gates said. \"And then the other countries who are less engaged can look at that and see what they think, give it a fresh evaluation. And, you know, that data on that won't be in for almost another eight years or so,\" Gates said.After decades of nuclear power generation, there is still no permanent repository for nuclear waste in the United States. The closest the U.S. nuclear industry got to a permanent nuclear waste repository was at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, but that effort has been stalled because of political impasses.Currently, nuclear waste is stored in dry casks, which are stainless steel canisters surrounded by concrete. The top nuclear watchdog in the U.S., the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, considers these dry casks to be safe. The world's first permeant underground geological storage site is being constructed in Olkiluoto, Finland. Also, not all nuclear waste has the same level of radioactivity. Most of the radioactivity is in a very small percentage of the waste generated. \"The vast majority of the volume of nuclear waste there is Low Level Waste,\" Jonathan Cobb, spokesperson for the World Nuclear Association, told CNBC. \"Around 90% of the volume of nuclear waste produced is LLW, but it contains only 1% of the radioactivity. This can include things like protective clothing, mops, filters, equipment and tools that have become contaminated with radioactive material at a low level. One common category of LLW comes from nuclear medicine use and can include swabs, injection needles and syringes.\" Meanwhile the high-level nuclear waste, which includes used nuclear fuel or higher activity wastes from reprocessing, is \"about 3% of the volume of radioactive wastes produced, but contains 95% of the radioactivity,\" Cobb told CNBC."

    "content": "Improvements in artificial intelligence are the \"most important\" innovation at the moment, billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates said in an interview published Friday. \"This will change our world,\" he continued. The applications of generative AI like OpenAI's ChatGPT could improve office efficiency, drafting invoices and letters, Gates said in a podcast conversation with the German-language business paper, Handelsblatt. \"Today, they require too much computation, they're not always accurate,\" Gates said, \"But even this week, you'll have announcements from Microsoft and Google, where they're competing to lead in this space.\" Microsoft announced this week that its Bing search engine will be powered in part by ChatGPT AI technology. Google also recently announced Bard, its ChatGPT competitor. Gates co-founded Microsoft in 1975 and led the company for over two decades, before stepping down as CEO in 2000. \"I'm biased,\" Gates joked, noting that he remained a consultant for the roughly $2 trillion company. The optimizations that AI can offer for reading and writing, Gates said, will make a \"huge impact.\" In the health care and education spaces, Gates said, AI can tangibly improve efficiency and meaningfully improve outcomes. \"The easiest way to understand it is that AI has got very good at speech recognition and visual recognition, but they essentially couldn't read,\" he said. In other words, traditional AI platforms couldn't actually process the language they were taking in. But newer platforms, like ChatGPT, are capable of training, improving, and reading and writing through new knowledge. Gates pointed to applications within word processing and office tasks as optimal future applications for natural language platforms like ChatGPT. As an example, Gates pointed to a hypothetical integration with Microsoft's Teams collaboration software, noting that the AI could keep track of the conversation to produce relevant information based on a meeting. \"The progress over the next couple of years to make these things even better will be profound,\" Gates said."

    "content": "Shares of Lyft fell more than 35% when markets opened Friday, a day after the company reported guidance for its first quarter of 2023 that fell short of analyst expectations. The company expects to bring in about $975 million in revenue in Q1, while analysts had been anticipating $1.09 billion, according to StreetAccount. Lyft's CFO pointed to \"seasonality and lower prices\" to explain the guidance. Lyft posted a revenue beat of $1.18 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022, compared with the $1.16 billion analysts were expecting, according to Refinitiv. It also posted earnings of 29 cents per share, adjusted, versus 13 cents per share expected in a Refinitiv survey of analysts. Wall Street noticed the contrast between Lyft's report and Uber's earnings. \"Our positive thesis on Lyft had been based on post-pandemic recovery combined with an accelerated shift to profit through cost rationalization. However, rideshare is now approaching full recovery in the US, but Lyft is not,\" JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth said.

    "content": "This is CNBC's live blog tracking developments on the war in Ukraine. See below for the latest updates.Moldova's Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita said Friday that her government was resigning following a volatile 18 months in power and an ongoing war at its border. Gavrilita did not say whether the decision was in direct response to the war between neighboring Ukraine and Russia. The announcement came shortly after the country's defense ministry said a Russian missile violated its airspace and summoned its Russian envoy amid a fresh Russian assault on Ukraine.Explosions were heard across the Ukrainian capital Kyiv Friday, with missiles targeting several high-voltage facilities across the country and disrupting power supply. Moscow is launching another major offensive focused primarily on eastern Ukraine, with Russian military attempting to break through defenses close to the town of Kreminna, the governor for the Luhansk region said. The southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia was hit with at least 17 missiles in an hour, according to local officials, while Kharkiv also reported about 10 explosions and said power had been cut in some areas. Elsewhere, the Central Bank of Russia on Friday left its key interest rate unchanged at 7.5% per annum, citing stronger-than-expected economic activity trends. That follows an announcement by Moscow that it would cut oil production by 500,000 barrels per day in March after the West slapped price caps on Russian oil and oil products.Four vessels carrying more than 178,000 metric tons of grain and other food products have left Ukrainian ports, the organization overseeing the export of agricultural products from the country said. The ships are destined for Spain and Kenya and are carrying wheat and corn. TheBlack Sea Grain Initiative, a deal brokered in July among Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and the United Nations, eased Russia's naval blockade and saw three key Ukrainian ports reopen. So far, more than 690 ships have sailed from Ukrainian ports.  Amanda MaciasThe price cap on Russian oil continues to meet objectives and any Russian production cuts will disproportionately hurt developing countries, a G7 price cap coalition official said. The official also said public reporting shows a significant amount of Russian seaborne oil has been shipped via price cap-compliant tankers and that it was important not to take Russian comments on oil production cut at face value. Earlier on Friday, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said Russia said it will cut oil production by 500,000 barrels per day, or around 5% of output in March. The move comes after the West imposed price caps on Russian oil and oil products.  ReutersU.S. President Joe Biden will travel to Poland later this month and deliver remarks ahead of the one-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The White House said Biden, who will travel on Feb. 20, will also meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda to discuss ways to continue supporting Kyiv. National security council spokesman John Kirby declined to say if Biden will stop in Ukraine while visiting Poland.  Amanda MaciasUkraine's Minister of Energy German Galushchenko said that Russia's recent massive missile and drone attack has caused damage to energy facilities in six different regions of Ukraine.  Galushchenko added on Facebook that emergency blackouts are now in effect across most regions of Ukraine. Earlier on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russian forces launched 70 missiles across Ukraine.  Amanda MaciasCeleste Wallander, assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, said Russia's military is believed to have lost half of its main battle tanks in Ukraine. \"Russia's conventional, especially ground capabilities have been significantly degraded,\" Wallander told an audience at the Center for a New American Security, or CNAS, a Washington-based think-tank. Wallander said the U.S. estimates Russian forces have suffered tens of thousands\" of casualties.  She previously served as former President Barack Obama's Russia expert on his National Security Council and currently holds one of the most far-reaching Pentagon policy roles under President Joe Biden.  \"That said, Russia retains a defense industrial base ... Russia has also drawn upon partnerships that it has to fill in some of the gaps, most notably Iran,\" Wallander said in a discussion with CNAS senior fellow Becca Wasser. \"I think that we need to be mindful of the fact that as Russia continues to suffer losses in Ukraine, it is also learning how to adapt. It is learning both technically and operationally and somewhat strategically,\" Wallander added.  Amanda MaciasUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated calls to ban Russian athletes from competing in the Olympic Games. \"228 Ukrainian athletes and coaches died during the year of Russian aggression against Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy said in an address to the nation. Zelenskyy juxtaposed the terror in his country with the upcoming games by saying, \"if the Olympic sports were killings and missile strikes, then you know which national team would occupy the first place.\" The Ukrainian president said that Russian forces fired at least 70 missiles at civilian infrastructure in the early morning hours on Friday.  Amanda MaciasMore than 8 million Ukrainianshave become refugees and moved to neighboring countries since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, the U.N. Refugee Agency estimates. Nearly 4.8 million of those people have applied for temporary resident status in neighboring Western European countries, according to data collected by the agency. \"The escalation of conflict in Ukraine has caused civilian casualties and destruction of civilian infrastructure, forcing people to flee their homes seeking safety, protection and assistance,\" the U.N. Refugee Agency wrote.  Amanda MaciasSince Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, there have been at least 764 attacks on vital health services in the country, the World Health Organization'sSurveillance System for Attacks on Health Careestimates. The organization reports that healthcare facilities were damaged 678 times, ambulances were targeted in 98 cases and at least 191 attacks affected crucial medical supplies. The group also estimated that attacks on health services led to at least 100 deaths and 131 injuries. The Kremlin has previously denied that it targets civilian infrastructure like hospitals, schools and apartment buildings.  Amanda MaciasDeputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo hosted a group of experts from more than 30 countries to discuss international sanctions and export controls on Russia for its war in Ukraine. \"Adeyemo shared that in the weeks and months ahead, Treasury will increase its focus on countering sanctions evasion, including by targeting facilitators and third-country providers that may wittingly or unwittingly help Russia replenish the supplies and material it desperately needs to support its military,\" the Treasury wrote in a readout of the meeting. In the weeks after Russia's invasion of its ex-Soviet neighbor, Washington and its allies have imposed rounds of coordinated sanctions vaulting Russia past Iran and North Korea as the world's most-sanctioned country.  Amanda MaciasUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russian missiles which crossed Moldovan airspace and narrowly skirted NATO member Romania Friday were a challenge to the military alliance. \"The enemy launched at least 70 rockets in another massive attack [on Ukraine] this morning,\" Zelenskyy said in a video posted on the Telegram messaging app. \"Several Russian missiles passed through the airspace of Moldova and Romania. These missiles are a challenge to NATO and collective security. This is terror that can and must be stopped,\" he added.  Karen GilchristRussia launched a fresh string of attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure in the cities of Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia on Friday as the country's officials warned that a long-awaited Russian offensive was underway. The southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia was hit with at least 17 missiles in an hour, acting mayor Anatolii Kurtiev said. Kharkiv regional governor Oleh Synehubov also reported about 10 explosions and said power had been cut in some areas.It comes amid a wider assault on the country's energy infrastructure Friday, with high-voltage facilities hit and electricity supplies shut down across various parts of the country. Air raid sirens blared across the country during the morning rush hour and local officials urged civilians to take shelter. Air force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat told Ukrainian television that Ukrainian air defenses had shot down five of seven drones and five out of six Kaliber missiles. Still, the air force said Russia had launched 35 S-300 missiles at the Kharkiv and Zaporizhizhia regions, which they were unable to shoot down.  Karen GilchristZelenskyy warned Moldova of Russia's attempts to undermine its government, he told EU leaders Thursday. The Ukrainian president's statement in Brussels came a day before Moldova's Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita said Friday that her government was resigning. \"I recently spoke with the President of Moldova, Mrs. Sandu. I informed her about what our intelligence has managed to intercept. A detailed Russian plan to undermine the political situation in Moldova,\" Zelenskyy said. \"A Russian document that shows who, when and through what actions was going to break Moldova. To break the democratic order of this country and establish their control over it,\" he continued. \"I did not hesitate for a single minute when I received this document and heard about its origin. I immediately warned about all these threats. I warned Moldova to protect it. And each of you would have done the same, each of you.\" Zelenskyy added that it was not clear whether Moscow gave an order to act according to this plan against Moldova. However, he said that his intelligence agencies recognized the plans as \"exactly what they had already tried to do against Ukraine and against other states.\"  Karen GilchristMoldova's Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita said Friday that her government was resigning following a volatile 18 months in power and an ongoing war at its border. \"I believe in the Moldovan people. I believe in Moldova. I believe that we will be able to make it through all the difficulties and challenges,\" Gavrilita, who assumed the post in August 2021, told a news briefing. She did not say whether the decision was in direct response to the war between neighboring Ukraine and Russia. It comes hours after Moldova's defense ministry said a Russian missile had violated its airspace. Moldova has faced economic upheaval and an influx of refugees since Moscow's invasion last year. It has also suffered a string of power cuts amid Russian air strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure. Still, the country's acceptance last year as an EU membership candidate was seen as a triumph for President Maia Sandu.  Karen GilchristGermany's finance minister warned Friday that Germany should learn from its experience with Russia amid a growing trade deficit with China. Christian Lindner described the more-than doubling of Germany's trade deficit with China in 2022 as a \"dangerous development,\" adding that the country should be cautious about allowing excessive dependences to build up.  Karen GilchristA Russian missile launched off a ship near Crimea on Friday crossed into Moldovan airspace before hitting Ukraine, skirting the northeast border of NATO state Romania by 35 kilometers, Romania's defense ministry said. \"The Romanian Air Force's surveillance system detected on Friday an air target, most likely a cruise missile launched from a Russian ship in the Black Sea near the Crimean Peninsula,\" the ministry said in a statement. \"The closest the target trajectory got to Romania's airspace was recorded by the radar at roughly 35 kms northeast of the border,\" it added. Ukraine's top general said Friday morning that two Kaliber missiles launched from the Black Sea had entered Moldovan airspace and flown into Romanian airspace before entering Ukraine. Moldova later confirmed its airspace had been violated. Russia has yet to respond to the comments.  Karen GilchristThe Central Bank of Russia on Friday left its key interest rate unchanged at 7.5% per annum, citing lingering inflationary risks and stronger-than-expected economic activity trends. The bank cut rates six times in 2022, taking the key rate from 20% following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February to 7.5% in September, holding it steady since. The Bank said current price growth rates were increasing, but \"remaining moderate in terms of sustainable components,\" and that \"inflation expectations of households and businesses edged down but remain elevated.\" \"Economic activity trends evolve better than the Bank of Russia's October forecast. Although households' consumer behavior is still cautious, there appear signs of recovery in consumer activity,\" the CBR said. \"Accelerating fiscal spending, deteriorating terms of foreign trade and situation in the labor market intensify pro-inflation risks.\" The Russian economy is undergoing a structural transformation as the Kremlin looks to minimize the impact of economic sanctions imposed following the invasion of Ukraine. Given the uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook, the CBR's baseline scenario forecasts GDP growth of between -1% and 1% in 2023 and 0.5% to 2.5% in 2024. These projections are notably higher than consensus among global economists.  Elliot SmithMoldova said a Russian missile entered its airspace on Friday morning, condemning the action and urgently summoning the Russian ambassador. \"The Ministry of Defense, in cooperation with the responsible structures of the country, closely monitors the situation in the region and strongly condemns the violation of the airspace of Moldova,\" the defense ministry said. \"We resolutely reject the latest unfriendly actions and statements against Moldova, which is absolutely unacceptable for our people. We call on the Russian Federation to stop military aggression against a neighboring country, leading to numerous human casualties and material damage,\" it added. Russia has not yet commented on the claims.  Karen GilchristZelenskyy will address a summit on Friday to discuss Russia's participation in next year's Paris Olympics amid warnings that his country may boycott the Games. The Ukrainian president will make a video address to more than 30 countries currently considering how to respond to the prospect of Russian and Belarusian athletes competing at the sporting event. The International Olympic Committee has said there are no plans for a delegation from either country to be present at Paris 2024. However, it added that it will \"explore as pathway\" for athletes from the two nations to compete under strict conditions as neutrals. Ukraine's Sports Minister Vadym Guttsait, who is also president of its Olympic Committee, said the country could boycott the Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete.  Karen GilchristRussian President Vladimir Putin is to deliver his annual address to the federal assembly on Feb. 21, the Kremlin said Friday. The date marks exactly one year since Russia recognized the two breakaway Ukrainian states of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states  a key precursor to Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. The federal assembly is a joint meeting of Russia's two houses of parliament.  Karen GilchristUkraine said two Russian missiles crossed over into Moldova and Romania Friday during a fresh assault by Moscow. The commander-in-chief of Ukraine's armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said Kaliber missiles launched from the Black Sea entered Moldovan airspace and flew into Romanian airspace before entering Ukraine. The Ukrainska Pravda media outlet also quoted Zaluzhnyi as saying separately that Ukraine did not shoot down the missiles so as not to endanger civilians in foreign countries, according to Reuters. The reports could not be immediately verified, nor did Russia immediately comment.  Karen GilchristRussian missile strikes across Ukraine prompted fresh calls for fighter jets and long-range weapons Friday. Ukraine's presidential advisor said Friday there had been \"enough talk\" and it was now time for Western allies to respond to Kyiv's requests. \"Russia has been striking at Ukrainian cities all night & morning,\" Mykhailo Podolyak wrote on Twitter. \"Enough talk (and) political hesitation. Only fast key decisions: long-range missiles, fighter jets, operational supplies logistics for Ukraine.\"   Karen GilchristRussia said Friday it will cut oil production by 500,000 barrels per day  around 5% of output  in March following Western leaders' move to implement price caps. \"As of today, we are fully selling the entire volume of oil produced, however, as stated earlier, we will not sell oil to those who directly or indirectly adhere to the principles of the 'price cap',\" Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said. \"In this regard, Russia will voluntarily reduce production by 500,000 barrels per day in March. This will contribute to the restoration of market relations,\" Novak added. The Group of Seven, European Union and Australia agreed to price caps on Russian oil and oil products from December.  Karen GilchristExplosions were heard in Kyiv Friday morning as high-voltage facilities across the country were hit by Russian missile attacks, according to reports from officials. Ukraine's power operator Ukrenergo said several facilities in eastern, southern and western Ukraine had been hit, disrupting power supply. In Kharkiv, the largest city in eastern Ukraine, an infrastructure facility was hit, with power outages likely, the city's major said. The energy operator said Ukraine's grid had been attacked with drones and missiles, targeting power stations and transmission facilities.

    "headline": "U.S. sanctions six Chinese tech companies for supporting spy balloon programs",
    "content": "WASHINGTON  The Commerce Department announced a new round of sanctions Friday targeting six Chinese aerospace companies that it identified as supporting the nation's military's reconnaissance balloon program.  The firms will join a growing list of companies based in China that the U.S. says pose serious threats to national security. The sanctions announcement came just hours after an American military F-22 shot down the second \"high altitude object\" to enter U.S. airspace in the past week. \"The PRC's use of high-altitude balloons violates our sovereignty and threatens U.S. national security,\"said  Alan Estevez, undersecretary of commerce for industry and security, using the acronym for the People's Republic of China. \"Today's action makes clear that entities that seek to harm U.S. national security and sovereignty will be cut off from accessing U.S. technologies,\" Estevez said in a statement from the Commerce Department. The craft that was shot down Friday was floating off the coast of Alaska. Last weekend, a high altitude Chinese surveillance balloon was shot down off the coast of South Carolina. The White House was hesitant to characterize the aircraft involved in the Friday incident as a balloon, however. \"We're calling this an object because that's the best description we have right now,\" said National Security Council spokesman John Kirby, adding that U.S. officials did not yet know which nation or group was responsible for it. The new sanctions reflect the administration's renewed focus this week on China's unmanned airship surveillance programs.  \"Today's action demonstrates our concerted efforts to identify and disrupt the PRC's use of surveillance balloons, which have violated the airspace of the United States and more than forty countries,\"said Matthew Axelrod, assistant secretary of commerce for export enforcement."

    "content": "WASHINGTON  The U.S. military shot down a second \"high altitude object\" in American airspace, this time off the coast of Alaska on Friday, the White House announced. The mission occurred less than a week after a high altitude Chinese surveillance balloon was shot down off the coast of South Carolina. White House spokesman John Kirby hesitated to characterize the aircraft as a balloon, saying \"we're calling this an object because that's the best description we have right now.\" He also said U.S. officials did not yet know which nation or group was responsible for it. The object was destroyed by a missile from an F-22 fighter plane off the far northeastern coast of Alaska, Kirby said at a White House press briefing. The U.S. military first became aware of the object on Thursday night. President Joe Biden gave the order to shoot it down on Friday morning, which was carried out shortly after noon.The craft was flying at approximately 40,000 feet in altitude, which is lower than the balloon last week, and it was the size of a small car, he said. Unlike the balloon shot down on Saturday, the latest object did not appear to possess any maneuverability, Kirby said. Last week's spy balloon was the size of three school buses, according to Pentagon officials. A sophisticated surveillance craft with propellers that gave it maneuverability, the balloon carried a payload the size of a jetliner. The latest incident also differed significantly from the prior one in that this floating object was shot down within hours of its detection. The larger, previous balloon was permitted to float across the United States for a week before Biden gave the order to shoot it down. The Pentagon defended that decision at a Senate hearing on Thursday, telling lawmakers that the spy balloon's primary value to the U.S. military lay in what could be learned from its flight course and its debris.\"A key part of the calculus for this operation was the ability to salvage, understand and exploit the capabilities of the high altitude balloon,\" said Assistant Secretary of Defense Melissa Dalton. Another factor influencing the decision to let the previous balloon remain in the air was that it was floating at approximately 60,000 feet in altitude, where it did not pose an immediate threat to civilian aircraft. Commercial airliners typically cruise at an altitude of 35,000 feet. The object shot down on Friday was floating at just 40,000 feet, however, creating what the White House called \"a reasonable threat\" to air safety. A Pentagon spokesman said Friday that the salvage operation for the latest object was already underway, but had been hampered by rough seas in the Arctic Ocean that made diving especially perilous."

    "headline": "Republicans back lawsuit to overturn FDA approval of abortion pill and pull the medication from U.S. market",
    "content": "Democratic and Republican attorneys general squared off on Friday in dueling arguments over an attempt by anti-abortion physicians to pull the abortion pill, mifepristone, from the U.S. market. New York led a coalition of 22 attorneys general who argued that pulling the pill would have \"devastating consequences\" for women. Mississippi led 22 Republican attorneys general who argued that the Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone is \"deeply flawed.\" The dueling arguments are part of an escalating federal court battle in Texas over a lawsuit filed by anti-abortion physicians last November, which seeks to overturn the FDA's more than two-decade-old approval of mifepristone. Used in combination with misoprostol, mifepristone isthe most common method to terminatea pregnancy in the U.S., accounting for about half of all abortions. The abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America,in an analysis published Friday, said 40 million women would lose access to the abortion pill if the court overturns the FDA's approval.Read CNBC's latest global health coverage:Read CNBC's latest global health coverage:The coalition led by New York argued that overturning the FDA approval would make the pill largely unavailable, forcing women to either undergo a more invasive surgical procedure or forgo abortion altogether. Surgical abortion is more costly and difficult to obtain, they argued, which would disproportionately impact women who are lower income, underserved or live in rural communities where there might not be access to a clinic. \"This would have devastating consequences,\" the attorneys general told Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who is presiding over the case in the U.S. District Court in Northern Texas. The coalition led by Mississippi backed the anti-abortion physicians claims, calling the FDA's actions on mifepristone \"deeply flawed.\" \"For two decades, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has acted to establish a nationwide regime of on-demand abortion by licensing sweeping access to chemical abortion drugsin defiance of federal and state laws protecting life, health, and safety,\" the Republican attorneys general argued. Later Friday, 67 Republican members of Congress filed a brief calling the FDA's approval of mifepristone \"unlawful,\" arguing it should be overturned. They claimed that the agency's actions subverted Congress' safeguards for patients. But the FDA has had regulations in place for years to monitor the safety of mifepristone, which it has gradually eased as more evidence has come in. The FDA,in its response last month, called the lawsuit \"extraordinary and unprecedented.\" The agency's lawyers said they could not find any previous example of a court second-guessing an FDA decision to approve a drug. The FDA approved mifepristone as a safe and effective method to terminate an early pregnancy based on extensive scientific evidence, the agency's lawyers wrote. Decades of experience among thousands of women have confirmed that the drug regimen is safer than surgical abortion or childbirth, the lawyers argued. Kacsmaryk on Thursday extended a key deadline in the case. He ordered one of the abortion pill makers, Danco Laboratories, to lay out its opposition to the lawsuit. The anti-abortion physicians who brought the case then have until Feb. 24 to respond. \"Forcing FDA to withdraw a longstanding approval would seismically disrupt the agency's governing authority as to whether drugs are safe and effective, and would cause Danco direct and immediate harm by shuttering its business,\" attorneys for Danco Laboratories told the court Friday. Mifepristone has become the central focus in the battle over abortion access since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last June. The FDA last month changed its regulations to allow certified retail pharmacies to dispense mifepristone. CVS and Walgreens, the nation's two largest drugstore chains, have said they are getting certified to dispense the prescription medication in states where it's legal to do so. Republican attorneys general have warned the companies against distributing the pill by mail in their states, indicating that they would take legal action. There are also lawsuits seeking to overturn state restrictions on mifepristone, arguing that they conflict with FDA regulations. GenBioPro, the other abortion pill manufacturer, is suing to overturn West Virginia's ban. A physician in North Carolina is challenging that state's restrictions. The New York led coalition of attorneys general arguing to keep mifepristone on the market include: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Washington, Wisconsin and Washington, D.C. The Mississippi led coalition arguing against the FDA approval of mifepristone include: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wyoming."

Those records were discovered after Pence asked outside counsel to look for them  a decision that Pence's lawyer said was prompted by the news that classified documents had been found at President Joe Biden's home in Delaware.The FBI and the Justice Department declined to comment on the search. A member of Pence's legal team was present throughout the search of his Carmel, Indiana, home, to which the DOJ was given \"unrestricted access,\" according to a person familiar with the matter. In addition to looking for classified documents, authorities searched for records that could be \"original Presidential Record Act documents,\" the person said. The DOJ assured that the scope of its search was the same for Pence as it was during searches of Biden's Delaware homes, according to the person. Neither Pence nor his wife, Karen Pence, were there at the time, the person noted."

    "headline": "National Archives, Smithsonian museum sued after visitors told to remove 'pro-life' clothing",
    "content": "More than a dozen abortion opponents sued the National Archives and Records Administration and the National Air and Space Museum after security guards there ordered them to remove or hide clothing with \"pro-life\" messages during separate visits while attending the March for Life in Washington, D.C., last month. Both NARA and the federally funded Smithsonian Institution, which operates the museum, issued statements on the lawsuits and apologized for the incidents, which occurred months after the Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion. Both statements admitted that the security guards were wrong on Jan. 20 to demand they hide or remove the \"pro-life\" messages while touring the archives and the museum. NARA is home to the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution and other historically significant documents. The Air and Space Museum is the largest of the Smithsonian's museums. Both entities are located along the Mall in Washington. \"As the home to the original Constitution and Bill of Rights, which enshrine the rights of free speech and religion, we sincerely apologize for this occurrence,\" NARA said. \"NARA policy expressly allows all visitors to wear t-shirts, hats, buttons, etc. that display protest language, including religious and political speech,\" the statement said. \"We are actively investigating to determine what happened,\" NARA said it would not comment on the suit itself. The Smithsonian in its statement said, \"A security officer mistakenly told young visitors that their pro-life hats were not permitted in the museum. Asking visitors to remove hats and clothing is not in keeping with our policy or protocols. We provided immediate retraining to prevent a re-occurrence of this kind of error.\" \"The Smithsonian welcomes all visitors without regard to their beliefs,\" the statement said. \"We do not deny access to our museums based on the messages on visitors' clothing.\" The suits, filed earlier this week in Washington, D.C. federal court, allege the plaintiffs' civil rights under the First and Fifth amendments of the U.S. Constitution were violated by the NARA, the museum and unidentified security officers on Jan. 20. The March for Life, which opposes abortion, was occurring the same day. The First Amendment prohibits governments and their agencies from restricting free speech, and the Fifth Amendment guarantees citizens equal protection under the laws. The plaintiffs in the suits are being represented by lawyers from the American Center for Law & Justice, a conservative, Christian organization. The suit against the Air and Space Museum said the nearly dozen Catholic plaintiffs were students, parents or chaperones of Our Lady of the Rosary Church and School in Greenville, South Carolina. All of the plaintiffs were wearing blue hats with the inscription \"Rosary Pro-Life,\" the suit says. The complaint said they were told to remove those hats are various times and locations in the musuem. One guard allegedly told several of the plaintiffs, Y'all are about to make my day,\" and added, \"You've been told multiple times to take your hats off, and you have not taken them off. You need to take them off or leave.\" That guard allegedly said, the First Amendment \"does not apply here.\" The suit against NARA says, \"On January 20, 2023, each of the Plaintiffs visited the National Archives to view those documents that affirm their God-given right to free speech, expression, and their exercise of religious beliefs.\" The adult plaintiffs did not know each other before the lawsuit was filed, the suit says. Two of the plaintiffs, a Michigan woman identified as Tamara R., and her 17-year-old daughter L.R., were there with a group of about 15 students and parents from L.R.'s Catholic high school, the suit says. The mother is suing on behalf of her daughter, who \"holds a deeply religious belief that she has a religious and moral obligation to speak out against the abortion of innocent babies,\" the suit says. Another plaintiff, Wendilee Walpole Lassiter, is a Virginia resident and Protestant who was with a group of students from her private religious school, Liberty University School of Law, the suit says. The other plaintiff, Terrie Kallal, is an Illinois resident and a \"devout Catholic,\" according to the suit. When L.R., her mom and fellow classmates were in the building's Rotunda, where the Bill of Rights is housed, a security guard approached them and told L.R. and the other students \"to remove all pro-life attire,\" the suit says. L.R. was specifically told to cover her shirt, which said, \"Life is a Human Right,\" and not to unzip the jacket over it until she left the National Archives, according to the suit. The guard told her classmates to remove buttons and hats carrying pro-life messages, the suit alleges. One hat said \"LIFE always WINS,\" and another said, \"ProLife,\" according to the suit. \"Plaintiff L.R. communicated to a friend via Snapchat while still inside the National Archives, 'he told me to take off my pro-life pin as I was standing next to the constitution that literally says Freedom of Speech on it,'\" the suit alleges.Read more of CNBC's politics coverage:Read more of CNBC's politics coverage:L.R. later says three different National Archives employees inside the gift shop confronted her classmates and told them to \"immediately\" remove their pro-life clothing. During Lassiter's visit, a guard approached her when she passed through a metal detector and ordered her to remove her sweatshirt, which said, \"I am the post-Roe Generation: Law Students for Life,\" according to the lawsuit. The guard told her: \"You have to take your shirt off. Your shirt will incite others,\" and \"would cause a disturbance. You're disturbing the peace,\" the suit says. Lassiter, who complied, said she later saw two other Archives visitors wearing what appeared to be messages supporting abortion rights, one of which said, \"My Body, My Choice,\" and \"Pro-Choice,\" according to the suit.Read more of CNBC's politics coverage:Read more of CNBC's politics coverage:The other plaintiff, Kallal, said she and her granddaughter likewise were told to cover up their t-shirts, one of which said \"MARCH 4 LIFE 2014: Saint Cecilia's Youth Group, Glen Carbon, IL,\" the other which said, \"Pro-life generation.\" One guard told them, \"Your clothing is offensive. You must zip up your coats or take off your shirts,\" the suit said. Kallal later saw other students leaving the building after being told to cover their pro-life message clothing, saying \"they would rather leave than give up their right to free speech,\" according to the lawsuit. NARA, in its statement Friday, said \"early indications are that our security officers quickly corrected their actions and, from that point forward, all visitors were permitted to enter our facility without needing to remove or cover their attire.\" NARA said it has reminded all of its security staff at locations nationwide \"of the rights of visitors in this regard.\""

Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk on Thursday ordered one of the companies that makes the pill, Danco Laboratories, to lay out its opposition to the attempt to pull the medication from the U.S. market. The anti-abortion physicians who originally filed the lawsuit then have until Feb. 24 to reply. \"Briefing will then be closed on the matter, absent any 'exceptional or extraordinary circumstance,'\" Kacsmaryk wrote. The Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, a coalition of physicians who oppose abortion, sued the FDA in November over its more than two-decade-old approval of mifepristone. Used in combination with misoprostol, mifepristone is the most common method to terminate a pregnancy in the U.S., accounting for about half of all abortions. \"Forcing FDA to withdraw a longstanding approval would seismically disrupt the agency's governing authority as to whether drugs are safe and effective, and would cause Danco direct and immediate harm by shuttering its business,\" the attorneys for the abortion pill maker Danco Laboratories told the court on Friday. The abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America, in an analysis published Friday, said 40 million women would lose access to the abortion pill if the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine succeeds and mifepristone is effectively banned. The alliance argued that the FDA abused its authority by approving mifepristone in 2000 through an accelerated process for new drugs that benefit patients with serious or life-threatening illnesses more than what is otherwise available on the market. The FDA, in its response, called the lawsuit \"extraordinary and unprecedented.\" The agency's lawyers said they could not find any previous example of a court second-guessing an FDA decision to approve a drug. The agency also said mifepristone was not approved under an accelerated pathway. It took more than four years from the filing of the initial application until the pill was approved.  The FDA approved mifepristone as a safe and effective method to terminate an early pregnancy based on extensive scientific evidence, the agency's lawyers wrote. Decades of experience among thousands of women have confirmed that the drug regimen is safer than surgical abortion or childbirth, the lawyers argued. The FDA warned that pulling mifepristone from the U.S. market would result in worse health outcomes for patients who rely on the pill to safely end pregnancies. It would also weaken the FDA's drug approval powers and hinder development by creating regulatory uncertainty in the marketplace. \"If longstanding FDA drug approvals were so easily enjoined, even decades after being issued, pharmaceutical companies would be unable to confidently rely on FDA approval decisions to develop the pharmaceutical-drug infrastructure that Americans depend on to treat a variety of health conditions,\" the Biden administration lawyers wrote. Two separate lawsuits are also seeking to overturn state restrictions on mifepristone, arguing that they conflict with FDA regulations. GenBioPro, another company that makes the pill, is suing to overturn West Virginia's ban on these grounds. A physician in North Carolina has also sued to toss out restrictions on mifepristone in that state. Republican attorneys general in 20 states also recently warned CVS and Walgreens against mailing the abortion pill in their states, indicating that they would take legal action. CVS and Walgreens, the nation's two largest drugstore chains, are in the process of getting certified to dispense mifepristone in states where it is legal to do so. The FDA recently changed its regulations to allow retail pharmacies to dispense the prescription medication as long as they are certified.Read CNBC's latest global health coverage:Read CNBC's latest global health coverage:"
