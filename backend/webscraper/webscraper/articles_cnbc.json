The APE stock was issued less than a year ago.\nShares of the company fell more than 15% Tuesday.\nPreliminary results for Tuesday's meeting show that the APE conversion proposal passed with 978 million votes, or 88% of those cast. The second proposal, the reverse split of the company's common shares at a ratio of 10:1, passed by a similar margin.\n\"I would like to commend our shareholders for the wisdom exhibited in your votes by approving these proposals, and doing so by a wide margin,\" said CEO Adam Aron following the vote. \"This is a landslide victory that shows your determination to keep AMC a strong and innovative company and the leader of our industry.\"\nHe also noted that APE conversion vote will eliminate the gap between the value of AMC shares and the preferred dividend, which has hampered the company's efforts to sell stock.\nHowever, a Delaware Chancery Court injunction hearing planned for April 27 could delay any new debt-raising action by the world's largest theatrical exhibitor.\nThe hearing is centered around a class-action lawsuit that claims AMC circumvented shareholders who were against adding more shares by creating the preferred stock APE. The ticker symbol APE is a reference to AMC retail investors who dubbed themselves \"Apes.\"\nAron also addressed the April hearing, telling investors that he would keep them updated on developments.\nTuesday's vote comes less than a month after AMC posted disappointing fourth quarter earnings. The company saw revenue fall 15% to $990.4 million from $1.17 billion in the prior-year period.\nLosses also widened, as AMC posted a net loss of $287.7 million, a steeper fall than the $134.4 million in losses it posted a year ago.\nEssentially, AMC continues to spend more on operating costs and rent than it is making from admissions and concessions.

And so I searched and scoured the house looking for where the noise was coming from before I realized that it was just in my head.\"\nAs the years passed, the 35-year-old said, his hearing issues got worse. Department of Veterans Affairs records shared by Frei with CNBC show he was later diagnosed with tinnitus.\n\"It's constant,\" he said. \"It's a loud ringing in my ears — very similar to just like a buzz noise.\"\nHe said the ringing is so disruptive it occasionally keeps him awake.\n\"I don't look like somebody who probably should have as much hearing loss as I do at my age,\" he said.\nEric Rucker, an attorney for 3M, told CNBC the company has great respect for the men and women in the military and that their safety has always been a priority.\n\"The purpose of the creation of [the Combat Arms earplugs] was to collaborate with the military to solve one of the longest-standing problems they have had, that soldiers won't wear their hearing protection around loud noises and in combat,\" Rucker said.\nRucker said the plugs were designed in collaboration with the U.S. military\nby the Air Force, Army, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and others.\n\"All of that testing shows the Combat Arms earplugs, when properly fitted and when used according to its instructions, work to protect people's hearing,\" he said.\nRucker conceded that military audiologists were \"well trained in how to train people and fit people for the use of earplugs,\" but maintained, \"it should have worked and protected their hearing in environments where it was appropriate to be using these earplugs.\"\n, accusing 3M of selling \"dangerously defective\" earplugs, the\nto resolve the allegations without admitting liability.\nSoon after, there was a flood of new suits from hundreds of thousands of other service members.\nToday, the lawsuits have been consolidated in Florida federal court, creating what some are calling\n, surpassing even the multidistrict litigation involving\ntalc products.\n3M has lost 10 of the 16 cases that have gone to trial so far, with a total of $265 million awarded to 13 plaintiffs to date.\n\"There have been several bellwether trials.

This has been confirmed by every independent, third-party organization that has tested the product, including the Army Research Lab, the Air Force Research lab, NIOSH, and others.\"\nMizuho's executive director Brett Linzey wrote in a note to clients that \"even the low end of previously settled Combat Arms lawsuits (or even half that amount) equates to some pretty healthy liabilities 3M may have to address.\"\nAccording to one Wall Street analyst, 3M's liability risk could potentially be in the billions.\n\"Do the math on the number of plaintiffs, which is north of 200,000 and you take the average settlement value — the simple math on that gets you well north of $10 billion to $20 billion,\" JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa told CNBC. 3M told CNBC that estimate was \"completely speculative.\"\n\"We will continue to defend the cases. But the vast majority of these claims do not have complete information,\" said Rucker.\nIn a legal maneuver that would indemnify 3M, the company's attorneys attempted to put its subsidiary Aearo Technologies into bankruptcy protection, and put aside a $1 billion trust to settle the suits. The service members suing 3M are accusing the company of using the bankruptcy to shield itself and have asked a judge to dismiss it.\nA ruling on that potential dismissal is scheduled for April. Oral arguments for the appeal of the initial bellwether trials are scheduled for May 1.\nAs for Frei, he expects his case to go to trial by year-end.\n\"It does make me mad,\" Frei told CNBC, accusing 3M of \"trying to scheme away through either bankruptcy or through these arguments to try and avoid responsibility for what they've done.\""},

The Federal Communications Commission in 2020 authorized Amazon's system, in which the company has said it will \"invest more than $10 billion\" to build.\nThe \"standard\" design measures under 11 inches square and 1 inch thick, and weighs under 5 pounds. Amazon says the device will deliver speeds to customers of \"up to 400 megabits per second (Mbps).\"\nAn \"ultra-compact\" model, which Amazon says is its smallest and most affordable, is a 7-inch square design that weighs about 1 pound and will offer speeds up to 100 Mbps. In additional to residential customers, Amazon plans to offer the antenna to government and enterprise customers for services like \"ground mobility and internet of things.\"\nAmazon Senior Vice President of Devices and Services Dave Limp declined to say how much it costs to make each ultra-compact antenna, but told CNBC that it is \"materially less\" expensive to make than the standard model.\nIts largest \"pro\" model, at 19 inches by 30 inches, represents a high-bandwidth version for more demanding customers. Amazon says this antenna will be able to \"deliver speeds up to 1 gigabit per second (Gbps)\" via space. Badyal told CNBC there are a variety of enterprise and government applications for the pro series, such as \"oil rigs in the middle of the ocean\" or \"ships that want lots of bandwidth,\" such as military vessels.\nAmazon has yet to say what it expects the monthly service cost for Project Kuiper customers will be.\nIn showing early customers its antennas, Limp said he's seen them get \"excited\" about the lineup.\n\"They're surprised by the price points, surprised at the performance for the size, and [the antennas] are solid state so there's no motors,\" Limp told CNBC.\nAmazon said it expects to begin mass-producing commercial satellites by the end of this year. Limp told CNBC that once Amazon's manufacturing facility is fully built, the company expects to manufacture up to \"three to five satellites per day at scale.\"\n\"We'll ramp up to that volume,\" Limp said.\nThe company's first two prototype satellites are scheduled to launch on the debut mission of United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket, set for May.\nBadyal told CNBC that Amazon expects to make \"minor tweaks\" from the prototypes to the commercial version, as the satellites are \"almost identical\" but represent the first time much of the company's hardware has flown in space.\nWhile Amazon has yet to show off its satellites, or reveal many details, Limp noted that the Kuiper spacecraft are \"larger mass\" than the first generation of SpaceX's Starlink satellites, with Amazon aiming for \"Goldilocks-sizing.\" And Amazon expects the performance of its Kuiper satellites to \"outperform them significantly\" when compared to Starlink, with expected performance of processing up to 1 terabit per second (Tbps) of traffic. The satellites are expected to have a lifespan in space of about seven years, before they need to be replaced.\nLaunches of production satellites are scheduled to begin in the first half of 2024, with initial service slated for once the company has a few hundred satellites in orbit, Limp noted.\nLast year, Amazon announced\n, and has booked 77 launches – deals that included options for more when needed – from a variety of companies to deploy the satellites fast enough to meet regulatory requirements.\nLimp said that those launches mean Amazon has \"enough to get the vast majority of the constellation up\" in space.\n\"I don't think you're ever done thinking about launch capacity, but we feel pretty good about what we have on the order books,\" Limp added. \"If new vehicles come online, that are more competitive, we're going to look at it.\"\nNotably, Amazon has not purchased launches from SpaceX, the most active U.S. rocket launcher. Instead, Amazon has tapped a variety of competitors, purchasing rides largely on rockets that have yet to debut.\n\"I don't have any religious issue not to buy capacity from SpaceX, they're a very reliable rocket, but the Falcon 9 economically wasn't the best rocket for us,\" Limp explained.\nAsked whether Amazon would consider owning a rocket system to support its launches, Limp said, \"I would never say never to a question like that\" but that the company looks for acquisitions in areas \"where you can have something that's differentiated and it's something where it's not well-served.\"\nLimp noted that it's a different scenario than something like \"Prime Air,\" the company's cargo airline, as that was a situation in which the company's forecast for e-commerce growth was higher than transportation providers like FedEx or UPS or USPS believed.\n\"We were just using a lot of the excess capacity ... only then when it stopped becoming well served did we look at it,\" Limp said. \"There was a shift in it being well-served for our needs. Right now, I don't see that from a rocket perspective. There is a lot of launch out there.\""},

The researchers found molecular evidence that raccoon dogs and other animals susceptible to Covid were sold at the market, which is consistent with hypotheses about the virus spilling into humans from a wild animal.\nThe new data doesn't provide a conclusive answer to how the pandemic began, \"but it does provide more clues\" about a potential host of the virus that spread it to humans, said Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's Covid-19 technical lead. She called on China to publicly release the data so the WHO and other researchers can further analyze it and inch closer to understanding the origins of a pandemic that has killed millions of people worldwide.\n\"The big issue right now is that this data exists and that it is not readily available to the international community,\" said Van Kerkhove. \"This is first and foremost absolutely critical, not to mention that it should have been made available years earlier, but that data needs to be made accessible to individuals who can access it, who can analyze it and who can discuss it with each other.\"\nThe WHO's call comes as the debate over the origin of Covid intensifies.

The WHO is pushing for studies to be conducted in other markets in Wuhan and across China, according to Van Kerkhove. It is also seeking serology tests, which measure antibodies, for people who worked at the markets.\nVan Kerkhove also noted that \"all hypotheses\" on how Covid entered the human population are still on the table. She said more research is needed on potential breaches in biosecurity from a lab or whether the virus originated in a bat before jumping to humans.\nWe don't have all of the information in front of us, and we need to be able to look at all of these different hypotheses. We need to look at all of the data that are needed to assess each one of these so that we can say this may have happened, this may not have happened,\" she said.\nShe added that the WHO \"won't be able to remove different hypotheses\" until China reuploads its data.\nFBI Director Christopher Wray\nearlier this month that the bureau believes Covid most likely originated in a Chinese government-controlled lab.\nIn February, the Department of Energy\nthat Covid leaked from a lab.\nRoughly 44% of U.S. adults believe the virus spilled from a virology lab in Wuhan, China, while 26% say it moved naturally from animals to humans, according to a Morning Consult poll\nlast month."},

The White House said SVB's CEO reportedly sold more than $3 million in shares mere days before the FDIC took it over. Under current Dodd-Frank legislation, the FDIC only has the ability to recoup these funds at the nation's largest financial institutions, not large and medium sized banks like the ones that failed over the weekend.\nBiden also called on Congress to expand the FDIC's authority to bar executives whose banks are under receivership from working in the banking sector and bring fines against executives of failed banks. All three of the White House's proposals seek to penalize banking executives for the risky behaviors leading up to the bank failures.\nThe nation's top bank regulators on Sunday announced the FDIC and Federal Reserve would\n, including those above the $250,000 limit covered by traditional FDIC insurance, at both failed banks: Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The agencies noted that Wall Street and large financial institutions — not taxpayers —\nthrough a\nassessed against federally insured lenders.\nA majority of SVB's customers were small tech companies, venture capital firms and entrepreneurs who used the bank for day-to-day cash management to run their businesses. Those customers had $175 billion on deposit with tens of millions in individual accounts. That left SVB with one of the highest share of uninsured deposits in the country when it collapsed, with 94% of its deposits landing above the FDIC's $250,000 insurance limit, according to\nfrom 2022.\nThe SVB failure was the nation's largest collapse of a financial institution since Washington Mutual went under in 2008. Signature Bank in New York,\nover similar fears its failure could pull other institutions down with it, had been a popular funding source for cryptocurrency companies.\nThe Federal Reserve also loosened its borrowing guidelines for banks seeking short-term funding through its so-called discount window. It also set up a separate unlimited facility to offer one-year loans under looser terms than usual to shore up troubled banks facing a surge in cash withdrawals. Both programs are being paid for through industry fees, not by taxpayers.\nThe president stressed the actions taken over the weekend were necessary to prevent further economic fallout but did not use taxpayer funds.\n\"Our banking system is more resilient and stable today because of the actions we took,\" Biden said. \"On Monday morning, I told the American people and American businesses that they should feel confident that their deposits will be there if and when they need them. That continues to be the case.\"\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen took questions from members of the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday about the moves taken to date to contain the damage. She stated not all depositors will be protected over the FDIC insurance limits of $250,000 per account as they did for customers of the two failed banks.\nMembers of Congress are currently weighing a number of legislative proposals intended to prevent the next Silicon Valley Bank-type failure.\nOne of these is an increase in the $250,000 FDIC insurance limit, which several senior\nhave called for in the wake of SVB's collapse. Following the 2008 financial crisis, Congress raised the FDIC limit from $100,000 to $250,000, and approved a plan under which big banks contribute more to the insurance fund than smaller lenders.\nLike the White House, Congress has limited power as to what it can do to punish individual executives of failing banks, because courts are the venue where the law imposes penalties on those found guilty of wrongdoing.\nA bill has already been introduced in the Senate, in response to the SVB collapse, that seeks to claw back two forms of compensation from top executives at failed banks: Bonuses and profits from stock sales.\nOn Tuesday, Sen.

Under the burden of increased regulation, smaller institutions and many regional banks were struggling to stay competitive. Unlike the mega-banks which enjoyed huge \"economies of scale,\" smaller banks could not absorb the regulatory costs.\nI am willing to be persuaded that we made a mistake when we took that step, and that if we had not, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank would still be operational. But to be honest, I have yet to see a sound argument that the collapses were caused by our legislation.\nWhile it exempted banks with assets between $50 billion and $100 billion from the mandatory application of the enhanced regulation requirements of Dodd-Frank, those banks were still subject to supervisory stress tests, and the Fed still retained the ability to apply other prudent standards to guarantee a sound bank and sound banking system. At the time of passage, the Federal Reserve had already recognized that not all banks need the same level of regulation, and as a result the Fed was \"tailoring\" its application of the regulations. Our bill simply drew a bright line for when that \"tailoring\" would be conducted; the Fed certainly still had the power to provide enhanced regulation to SVB based on its risk profile.\nThe law did not require changes to the liquidity-coverage ratio for banks of SVB's size, in the range of $100 billion to $250 billion in assets. Regulators used their own discretion to make those changes.\nAlso, quarterly liquidity stress tests were still mandated by the law. Apparently, those tests were not conducted at SVB. If they were, they did not appropriately identify the interest rate risk. (By the way, no bank in America could pass a \"run on the bank\" stress test. If all the bank depositors withdrew their deposits on the same day, any bank would fail regardless of liquidity or bank capitalization.)\nThe 2018 law did not alter bank regulators' powers to resolve failing banks and address financial instability. It did not prevent the Fed from imposing an increased level of supervision. The Fed had the authority to enhance the current level of regional bank supervision, a step the central bank is considering in the wake of the SVB failure.\nContrary to the current political spin on both the right and left, no shareholder or bank executive is getting \"bailed out.\" Once the smoke clears, the U.S. government will not have spent a dime of taxpayer dollars to protect depositors whose deposits exceeded $250,000.\nEarly indications are that the capital of the failing banks will be more than adequate to cover any costs. In fact, to guarantee that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. would have adequate resources to cover deposits in excess of $250,000, the FDIC withdrew $40 billion from the U.S. Treasury on March 10. That money was redeposited just four days later.\nThe Biden administration appropriately intervened to shore up confidence in the American banking system. The FDIC has guaranteed deposits beyond $250,000 to prevent the contagion of further bank runs. The Fed is reviewing its own supervisory actions, which should include an assessment of whether any other regional bank has the same interest rate risk and is being appropriately supervised. The Justice Department is investigating insider trading allegations.\nMore facts will emerge in the coming weeks and months. We need to look at the facts and ignore the spin machines. Sadly, I fear the unintended consequence of the political finger pointing will prompt individuals and businesses to move deposits to the four biggest banks, institutions which are truly too big to fail.\nThat consolidation is exactly the trend that the 2018 legislation sought to prevent."},

The Organization for Security and Cooperation and Europe (OSCE) said Russia's early bombing of a maternity hospital there was a war crime. Moscow denied that and has said since it invaded on Feb. 24 last year that it does not target civilians.\nPutin's visit had the air of a gesture of defiance after the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for his arrest on Friday, accusing him of the war crime of deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine.\nHe has not publicly commented on the move, but his spokesman said it was legally \"null and void\" and that Russia found the very questions raised by the ICC to be \"outrageous and unacceptable\".\nThe visit to Mariupol was the first that Putin has made to the Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine's Donbas region since the war started, and the closest he has come to the front lines.\nWhile Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has made a number of trips to the battlefield to boost the morale of his troops and talk strategy, Putin has largely remained inside the Kremlin while running what Russia calls its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine.\nKyiv and its allies say the invasion is an imperialistic land grab that has killed thousands and displaced millions of people in Ukraine.\nPutin's trip to Mariupol took place in darkness. State TV showed him at the wheel of a car, driving through the city in the company of his deputy prime minister, Khusnullin, and being briefed in detail on the rebuilding of housing, bridges, hospitals, transport routes and a concert hall.\nState media said he visited a new residential neighbourhood that had been built by Russian military with the first people moving in last September.\n\"Do you live here? Do you like it?\" Putin was shown asking residents.\n\"Very much. It's a little piece of heaven that we have here now,\" a woman replied, clasping her hands and thanking Putin for \"the victory\".\nResidents have been \"actively\" returning, Khusnullin told Putin. Mariupol had a population of half a million people before the war and was home to the Azovstal steel plant, one of Europe's largest, where Ukrainian fighters held out for weeks in underground tunnels and bunkers before being forced to surrender.\n\"The downtown has been badly damaged,\" Khusnullin said. \"We want to finish (reconstruction) of the centre by the end of the year, at least the facade part. The centre is very beautiful.\"\nThere was no immediate reaction to the visit from the Ukrainian government.\nMariupol is in the Donetsk region, one of four largely Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine that Putin moved in September to annex in an action rejected as illegal by most countries at the United Nations General Assembly.\nPutin travelled there by helicopter after a visit to Crimea on the ninth anniversary of its annexation by Russia from Ukraine.\nFrom Mariupol, he went to Rostov in southern Russia, where state TV on Sunday showed him meeting Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov, commander of Russia's war effort in Ukraine."},

Facts do matter,\" Davis told CNBC, as Costello was still appearing before the grand jury.\nCohen told NBC News that the lead prosecutor in the case determined that he was not needed to rebut Costello, his former legal advisor.\nCostello was prepared to tell grand jurors that Cohen is a liar who blamed Trump for his own legal troubles, and that he has embellished allegations against the former president, WNBC reported.\nCostello, who is a former federal prosecutor, has acted as a lawyer for former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who himself is another former personal attorney for Trump.\nTrump's allies are preparing a wave of reaction if and when Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg brings an indictment against the former president.\nAmerican First Policy Institute, a dark money nonprofit run by Trump administration alumni that pushes his policies, is prepping a response once an indictment is announced, according to Marc Lotter, a spokesman for the organization. The Manhattan DA has been investigating a hush money payment made to porn star Stormy Daniels shortly before Election Day in the 2016 presidential campaign.\nOne piece of research it intends to use to defend Trump is a\ntitled \"Political Prosecutions: Abusing Discretion in the Service of Politics.\" The report, reviewed by CNBC,\ntakes on Bragg's handling of a different case in New York.\nThe America First Policy Institute raised over $14 million in 2021 and had $3.8 million in total assets, according to its financial report. The organization doesn't publicly disclose their donors.\nThe Manhattan Republican Party is also preparing its own response to Bragg if such an indictment comes to pass, according to Andrea Catsimatidis, the chair of the county committee.\nCatsimatidis, daughter of New York billionaire John Catsimatidis, has already ripped Bragg for wanting to \"arrest of Donald Trump.\"\n—\nTrump shared a video tearing into Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg on the eve of the date Trump said he expected to be indicted by Bragg's office.\nThe 60-second\n, shared on Trump's social media site, Truth Social, contained many of the trappings of an attack ad against a political rival. A deep-voiced narrator hurled accusations at Bragg — including that his lax crime policies have turned New York City into a crime-ridden \"hellscape\" — over visuals of police lights, yellow crime-scene tape and at least one chalk outline of a body.\nIt was not immediately clear if the video was produced by Trump's presidential campaign. A spokesman for the campaign did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\nThe video also references a\nfrom Dailymail.com that a political committee backed by billionaire and Democratic donor George Soros pulled some funding from Bragg's 2021 campaign for DA following an unspecified allegation from an unnamed woman.

Jean Carroll, asked Judge Lewis Kaplan to consolidate her two suits, both of which claim Trump defamed her. Carroll's second lawsuit also contains a claim of battery, for her allegation that Trump raped her after a chance encounter in a Manhattan department store in the mid-1990s.\nKaplan ruled that attorneys for both sides overestimated the benefit of combining the cases.\nAnd the judge noted that the first case could end up getting dismissed by a Washington, D.C., federal appeals court based on the argument that Trump was acting within his job duties as president when he told reporters Carroll was lying in 2019 when she went public with her account.\nBoth cases are pending in Manhattan federal court. That is just down the street from New York state court, where a grand jury has been hearing testimony in a criminal investigation into whether Trump had his then-lawyer pay off porn star Stormy Daniels right before the 2016 election.\nThree Republican chairmen of House committees have issued a new letter to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, demanding records and interviews related to the Trump hush money case.\n\"Your decision to pursue such a politically motivated prosecution...requires congressional scrutiny about how public safety funds appropriated by Congress are implemented by local law-enforcement agencies,\" says the letter, dated Monday and signed by Judiciary Committee chair Jim Jordan of Ohio, Oversight Committee chair James Comer of Kentucky and Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, who leads the House Committee on Administration.\nThe letter follows Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's announcement over the weekend that he would instruct committees to look into the expected prosecution of former President Donald Trump.\nThe letter demands all documents and communications between New York state and federal law enforcement on the case against Trump since the start of 2017.

Trump, who had spent months denying the results of that election, pressured Pence to reject key Electoral College votes for Biden when presiding over a joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, 2021. After Pence refused, a violent mob of Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol, forcing Pence and members of Congress to flee their chambers.\nAsked in the ABC interview about Trump's calls for protest in response to his expected indictment, Pence said, \"I believe that people understand that if they give voice to this, if this occurs ton Tuesday, then they nee to do so peacefully and in a lawful manner.\"\nPence declined to weigh in on the merits of the Manhattan DA's possible case against Trump.\n—\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is widely expected to be considering a Republican presidential bid,\nover his expected prosecution of Trump.\nThe governor slammed DA Alvin Bragg as a \"Soros-funded prosecutor\" but offered little in defense of Trump, who is currently the frontrunner in the GOP presidential primary field.\n\"I don't know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some type of alleged affair, I just, I can't speak to that,\" DeSantis said at a news conference, prompting laughter from his audience.\n\"But what I can speak to is if you have a prosecutor who is ignoring crimes happening every single day in his jurisdiction and he chooses to go back many many years ago to try to use something about porn star hush money payments, that's an example of pursuing a political agenda,\" he added.\nThe remarks came as some of Trump's allies and campaign surrogates have\nof DeSantis' silence about the possibility of criminal charges being filed against the former president.\nDeSantis is expected to announce his presidential plans some time after the current Florida legislative session ends on May 5. Though he has yet to make his campaign official, polls of the potential primary field show him as Trump's biggest rival for the Republican nomination.\n—\nTrump is\nof a special purpose grand jury report in Fulton County, Ga., where he could be facing charges in a separate criminal case looking at whether he illegally interfered with the state's election process in 2020.\nIn a 52-page court\nMonday morning in Fulton County Superior Court, Trump's attorneys asked to quash that report and to bar the use of any evidence gathered by that panel.\nThe filing, which also included more than 400 pages of exhibits, additionally sought to disqualify the Fulton County District Attorney's Office, which has been conducting the criminal probe, from being involved in the case.\nThe Atlanta-area probe has spent the last two years investigating efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn President Joe Biden's win in Georgia in the 2020 election, in part by tossing out enough ballots cast for Biden to erase his victory.\nThe Georgia investigation has been considered a leading threat to end with criminal charges against Trump, who is the top contender for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. He's facing three other major pending criminal probes, including the Manhattan District Attorney's office that's investigating whether Trump illegally concealed a payment to porn star Stormy Daniels to buy her silence during the 2016 election.\n—\nHouse Speaker\ncriticized the idea of criminally charging his fellow Republican\n, but opposed a call by the former president for protests in New York over his expected indictment.\n\"Lawyer after lawyer will tell you this is the weakest case out there, trying to make a misdemeanor a felony,\" McCarthy said at the House Republicans' retreat in Orlando, Florida, on Sunday.\nBut the California lawmaker also said, \"I don't think people should protest this, no. And I think President Trump, if you talk to him, he doesn't believe that, either.\"\nTrump has said the exact opposite in a social media post, where he wrote that he \"will be arrested on Tuesday,\" and called on supporters to \"Protest, take our nation back.\"\nMcCarthy was among hundreds of lawmakers who fled to safety after a mob of Trump supporters invaded Congress on Jan. 6, 2021. The riot, which began after weeks of false claims by Trump that he had actually won the 2020 presidential election, disrupted for hours a joint session of Congress that was in the process of confirming the Electoral College victory of President\n.\n—\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg told his staff in an email that he will \"not tolerate attempts to intimidate our office or threaten the rule of law in New York,\" after\ncalled on his supporters to protest his expected indictment.\nBragg also said in an email to staff, obtained by NBC News, that their safety is a \"top priority,\" and that the office's law-enforcement parts are working on \"proper safeguards ... so all 1,600 of us have a secure work environment.\"\nTrump in a social media post wrote, \"THE FAR & AWAY LEADING REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE & FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WILL BE ARRESTED ON TUESDAY OF NEXT WEEK.\"\n\"PROTEST, TAKE OUR NATION BACK!\" wrote Trump, who is seeking the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.\nTrump also called on his supporters to protest after he lost the 2020 election, resulting in a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021 that has led to at least\n.\n—"},

We also do venture debt.' So many are going to emerge,\" Rae told CNBC in a phone conversation on Tuesday.\nVenture-backed startups are an unusual type of business. In their early stages, they might not have cash flow, revenues or even customers. Instead, they rely on venture funding, where investors offer cash in exchange for equity, hoping that the startups prove out their technology, find customers and eventually grow into giants.\nProviding banking to those kinds of customers requires special skills and an appetite for risk.\n\"Nobody understands startups as well as Silicon Valley Bank and how to lend to them,\" says\n, a longtime tech investor and co-founder of\n.\n\"I envision a startup's application getting simply annihilated by a big bank's risk committee,\" Bogue told CNBC.\nThat was exactly\n's experience back in May 2009.

He ardently hopes somebody can fill the gap left by SVB.\n\"Some folks may conflate their balance-sheet-driven meltdown with the failure of this startup-focused business model — but in fact, I think that banking startups continues to be a great business and a role that someone needs to fill,\" Clerico told CNBC. (Notably, Clerico is an angel investor in\n, a startup working to meet this need.)\n\"I hope SVB and their business model persists in some form,\" Clerico said.\nIn the climate tech ecosystem, SVB was especially prominent in making loans to companies with venture capital funding, known as \"venture debt.\" It's essential for startups that are still not generating enough cash flow to be self-sustainable, especially when they are between funding rounds.\n\"It adds a little bit to the capital that they've raised, extends their runway a little bit and gives them more time to make progress on their business,\" Rae told CNBC. Venture debt can add between three to six months to the runway companies already have, Rae said.\n\"There are other places that do venture debt, but Silicon Valley Bank was the 1,000-pound gorilla in the room,\" said\n, the CEO of the business lending consultant\n.\n\"The concern now is that even in instances where deposits are made whole, the credit facilities for companies with SVB are likely no longer available, and this is a sector where those are critical,\" Dajani said.\nThat said, making loans to venture-backed companies is a riskier endeavor than traditional banking, Kassar told CNBC.\n\"I always wondered how they managed to have the regulators allow them to have such a heavy concentration of venture debt,\" Kassar said.\nSVB was an early supporter of climate technology, helping a lot of climate tech companies get off the ground. But as the sector has matured, participants believe other financiers will be more willing to lend to those companies.\n\"Silicon Valley Bank's early support and commitment to supporting climate tech startups certainly helped catalyze the enormous migration of capital that you're now seeing deployed into the sector,\" Adam Braun, a founder of the climate startup\n, told CNBC.\nFor instance, SVB provided financing to 60% of community solar projects, said\n, the CEO of\n, a climate technology company that, among many services,\n.\nIn this, the bank \"was a climate bank pioneer,\" said\n, co-founder and CEO of\n, which has built a technology to help\n.\n\"But renewables have come a long way in the last decade and there's now a much wider universe of potential financiers looking to get on board,\" Speirs said.\nThat's what Braun expects to see, too.\n\"I believe we'll see many more institutions build dedicated climate practices and funds to support startups emerging in this space,\" Braun told CNBC. \"While SVB may have been a first mover, I don't think the events of last week will diminish the desire to finance and support the emerging companies that are leading the rapidly growing climate tech sector forward.\"\nFirst Republic and JPMorgan are \"increasingly making this category a priority,\"\n, a partner at the\n, told CNBC. \"More and more banks are paying attention to climate,\" Hamilton said.\n, a founder of the venture capital firm\n, agrees.\n\"Climate solutions are too powerful a force to be stopped by the failure of a bank,\" Casady told CNBC. \"The need is critical and time is not on our side to find solutions. Since this is a fundamental need, it will get more backing rather than less.\"\nThat transition will take time, however. And for companies working to combat global warming, time is the ultimate enemy.\n\"I do expect big banks to ultimately step up and provide the financing the industry needs to move forward — these projects are just too attractive and the promise of climate tech is too great. But it will take some time, and delays can be costly in the fight against climate change,\" Bhatraju told CNBC.\n\"With all the new investment in climate tech and the opportunities ahead afforded by the IRA [Inflation Reduction Act], there is a ton of momentum.

Zipline put its first fleet to work in Rwanda, delivering blood and other health supplies to clinics and hospitals. Since then, the Silicon Valley startup has expanded its service in six other countries, with limited delivery service and distribution centers in three states.\nOn Wednesday, Zipline showed off its next-generation aircraft, which it hopes will make rapid aerial deliveries an everyday convenience for customers throughout the U.S., even in densely populated urban areas.\nZipline's new drone, dubbed the Platform 2 or P2 Zip, is capable of carrying up to eight pounds worth of cargo within a ten-mile radius, and can land a package on a space as small as a table or doorstep.\n\"The reason that number is important,\" says Zipline CEO and co-founder Keller Rinaudo Cliffton, \"is that when you look at e-commerce in the US, a vast majority of packages weigh five pounds or less.\"\nThe P2 Zip can travel ten miles in ten minutes, and the company can make a delivery approximately seven times faster than any typical service you may order from today, the CEO said. Rapid deliveries by drone may put an end to \"porch pirates,\" Rinaudo Cliffton said, referring to the theft of packages left on a doorstep while the customer is away from home.\nWhile Zipline's original drone, the P1 Zip, features a fixed wing or glider-like design, the P2 employs both lift and cruise propellers and a fixed wing. These help it maneuver precisely and quietly, even in rainy or windy weather.\nTo deliver cargo to a customer's door, the P2 Zip hovers around 300 feet above ground level and dispatches a kind of mini-aircraft and container called the \"droid.\" The droid descends on a long thin tether, and maneuvers quietly into place with fan-like thrusters before setting down for package retrieval.\nZipline's original P1 drones will remain in production and in wide use, says Rinaudo Cliffton. The P1 Zip can fly a longer distance, delivering up to five pounds of cargo within a 60-mile radius, but it requires a larger space for take off, landings and \"the drop.\"\nThe P1 Zip lets cargo down with a parachute attached, so its payload lands within a space about the size of two car parking spots. After a P1 Zip returns to base, an employee needs to disassemble it, then set up a new one, dropping in a freshly charged battery for the next flight.\nZipline's new P2 Zip can dock and power up autonomously at a charging station that looks something like a street lamp with an arm and a large disc attached to that arm:\nZipline docks can be installed in a single parking spot or alongside a building depending on zoning and permits. Zipline envisions the docks set up by restaurants in a downtown shopping district, or alongside the outer wall of a hospital, where the droid can be inserted into a window or dumbwaiter, retrieved, and reloaded by healthcare workers indoors.\nSetting up one of these docks takes about as much work as installing an electric vehicle charger, Rinaudo Cliffton said.\nBefore developing the P2 Zip, Zipline had established logistics networks in Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Japan, Kenya, Nigeria and Rwanda already. It is operating some drone delivery networks in the US, in North Carolina, Arkansas and Utah -- but the P2 will help it expand that network.\nPartners who plan to test deliveries via P2 Zip include the healthy fast-casual restaurant Sweetgreen, Intermountain Health in Salt Lake City, Michigan Medicine, Multicare Healthcare System in Tacoma, Wash., and the government of Rwanda.\nZipline is not alone in its ambitions. Zipline is part of a program with other startups like DroneUp and Flytrex to make deliveries for\n. Amazon, meanwhile, has been working on making drone deliveries a reality here for nearly a decade, although that\nto overcome a thicket of regulation and low demand from test customers.\nZipline head of engineering Jo Mardall told CNBC the company focused much of its engineering on making sure the drones were not just safe and energy-efficient, but also quiet enough that residents would embrace their use.\n\"People are worried about noise, rightly. I'm worried about noise. I don't want to live in a world where there's a bunch of loud aircraft flying above my house,\" he said. \"Success for us looks like being in the background, being barely audible.\" That means something closer to rustling leaves than a car driving by.\nThe P2 Zips have a unique propeller design that makes this possible, Mardall explained, adding, \"The fact that the Zip delivers from from 300 feet up really helps a lot.\"\nMardall and Rinaudo Cliffton emphasized that Zipline aims to have a net-beneficial impact on the environment while giving business a better way to move everything from hot meals to refrigerated vaccines just in time to customers.\nUnmanned aerial vehicles, they explained, avoid worsening traffic congestion by going overhead. And since Zipline's drones are electric, they can be powered with renewable or clean energy, without the emissions from burning jet fuel, gasoline, or diesel.\nBut most importantly, the CEO said, Zipline's drone delivery allows companies to \"centralize more inventory,\" and \"dramatically reduce waste.\"\nA study\nfound that hospitals using Zipline services were able to reduce their total annual blood supply waste rate by 67%, the CEO boasted.\n\"That is a mind-blowing statistic, and a really big deal. It saves health systems millions of dollars, by reducing inventory at the last mile and only sending it when it's needed.\"\nZipline is aiming to bring that efficiency to every corner of commerce, the CEO said. It's also aiming to keep the cost of drone delivery competitive with existing services, like\nand\n, or food delivery apps like\nEats and Instacart.\nBut first, the startup plans to conduct more than 10,000 test flights using about 100 new P2 Zips this year. With its existing P1 drones, Zipline is already on track to complete about 1 million deliveries by the end of 2023, and by 2025 it expects to operate more flights annually than most commercial airlines."},

He urged clients to return their funds to the bank and to promptly alert their relationship teams of any issues with inbound or outbound wire transfers, a point of concern for many corporate executives who were unable to pull their deposits from the bank\n.\nMayopoulos was joined by SVB operating chief Phil Cox, the only remaining executive from the core C-suite team. SVB's former CEO and CFO are no longer employed by the bank, Mayopoulos said on the call.\nWhile Mayopoulos is making his pleas to current and former clients, it's not clear how long he will stay in his current job as the bank is currently controlled by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Mayopoulos said he doesn't know what SVB's \"exact end state\" would look like, and he listed three possibilities: recapitalization, sale, or liquidation.\nA recapitalization would allow SVB to continue to exist as a standalone entity. But that possibility depends on another financial institution or group of investors stepping up.\n\"I recognize I'm new on the scene,\" Mayopoulos said in direct response to concerns from\n. \"You've been patient with us as we've gone through some of those operational difficulties. All I would ask is give us a chance to win back your trust and confidence.\"\nMayopoulos' pitch was tailored towards the venture investors that have taken to social media in droves to express shock and dismay at the\nof a storied Silicon Valley institution. On the call, Mayopoulos repeatedly referred to the \"innovation economy,\" and to a startup ecosystem in which \"Silicon Valley has played an important part.\"\nCustomer feedback will be critical in determining the future of the bank, Mayopoulos said on the call. Input \"from clients and from the venture capital and entrepreneurial community\" would shape the timetable for SVB's ultimate emergence from government control.\n\"One of the things I want to convey to you is that you have some agency in this that you actually get to vote, at least to send clear signals about what you want the outcome of this process to be,\" the CEO said in his prepared remarks. \"If our clients choose to take their deposits and keep them in other institutions, that clearly limits the range of options that we have in terms of the ultimate outcome.\"\nSVB's longstanding relationship with Silicon Valley's most elite venture firms is mutually beneficial and symbiotic.\nFrom its founding at a poker table until the nearly fatal bank run last week, SVB was focused on taking risks in a market that most traditional banks shunned. SVB found a niche in venture debt, funding companies that needed cash infusions, especially between funding rounds.\nIn exchange for future consideration, often equity or warrants in a company, SVB became a mammoth player in the venture debt space, extending from software and internet into life sciences and robotics.\nIn its over 40 of business, SVB grew along with its depositors, building out a lucrative mortgage business and a suite of private-banking products that allowed it to retain and charm the founders whose fortunes the bank helped create.\nFrom legacy enterprises like Cisco to more modern tech companies such as DocuSign and Roku, SVB has focused on\nand banking services at every stage of growth.\n\"There are other places that do venture debt, but Silicon Valley Bank was the 1,000-pound gorilla in the room,\" said\n, CEO of the business lending consultant\n.\nExclusivity contracts, meaning an ironclad promise that a company would keep all its money at SVB, were a key facet of those funding deals. When SVB failed, it\nthat had traded banking flexibility for liquidity. Some fled the bank, violating their covenants to keep their lights on and thei\nrolling.\nWhen asked about potential exclusivity violations, Mayopoulos indicated that he understood emergency actions taken by startups.\n\"Given the change in circumstances and what the FDIC has done around insurance coverage, we'd very much like to work with our clients to have those deposits come back to us,\" the CEO said on the call.\nClients who return wouldn't have to worry about any fallout from breach of their covenants, Mayopoulos suggested. He didn't say what would happen to ex-customers who did the same."},

At 4 p.m. ET, he requested a $25 million wire transfer from Silicon Valley Bank, representing roughly 90% of his company's deposits.\nIt was too late.\ndidn't get a response on Thursday, and the following day SVB was\nby regulators in the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history. Dyrud had no idea when he'd be able to access his company's deposits, as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. only guarantees $250,000 per client.\nLike thousands of SVB customers, Dyrud was most immediately worried about\nfor March 15, which was just a few days away. He spent all day Friday and the weekend devising an emergency plan that centered around a $1 million loan from three board members, including from one investor who would be wiring funds to\n, the company's paycheck processor.\n\"We started planning to be without cash for nine months,\" said Dyrud, in an interview Tuesday. \"We had four plans in place in priority order in case something went wrong.\"\nDyrud sent a Slack message to his employees late last week, updating them on the situation.\n\"We ultimately expect to be made whole but need to prepare for alternate access to cash while this is sorted,\" Dyrud wrote in the memo, which he shared with CNBC.\nSVB's speedy collapse sent\nacross Silicon Valley as the failure of the preeminent bank for venture-backed startups threatened to indefinitely freeze access to the money companies need to pay their staff, vendors and partners, while also destabilizing the banking system.\nAccording to California regulators, investors and depositors\nfrom SVB by the end of Thursday after the bank said it was selling $21 billion worth of securities at a loss and trying to raise additional capital. Dyrud feared at the time that it would be the fastest bank run the country has ever seen due to the nature of the clientele and the speed with which information travels.\nOn Friday afternoon, Dyrud went with his chief administrative officer and controller to a local\nbranch, in Arlington, Virginia, to open a new account. It was the only bank that would open a same-day account for his 75-person startup, whose technology is used by agricultural companies and farmers to measure the health of their soil.\nThat evening, Dyrud held a 45-minute board meeting over\nto make sure everyone was aware of the gameplan and the loan arrangement, which was structured as an unsecured promissory note. Dyrud said he was on the phone 12 hours a day, starting Thursday.\nFour days of panic finally came to an end late Sunday, when regulators\nto backstop deposits and ensure that all clients would be able to retrieve their money starting Monday.\nBy early this week, EarthOptics had its cash safely in Wells Fargo and was repaying two investors for the loans. Dyrud said he was able to call off the loan from the third investor before the money was sent.\n\"It was the most heavily negotiated two-day loan ever,\" Dyrud said.\nfounder and CEO Sam Liang spent Monday driving to SVB branches in Silicon Valley to try and retrieve millions of dollars of his company's money.\nLiang said the company, whose software transcribes audio from meetings and interviews, tried to initiate a transfer Thursday night, but it never went through.\n\"We were pretty worried over the weekend, watching the news all the time,\" Liang said, in an interview on Monday from the parking lot of the SVB branch in Menlo Park, California. \"I checked\nlike 20 times an hour, watched [Treasury Secretary Janet] Yellen talking about not bailing out Silicon Valley Bank.\"\nHe woke up at 7 a.m. on Monday and tried logging into his account, but kept getting error messages because the system was overloaded. That's when he got in his car.\n\"I figured, OK I'll just go to an office physically,\" Liang said. \"I went to the Palo Alto office first. There was a line there, but a guy said they couldn't do much. I drove from the Palo Alto office to the Menlo Park office.\" At that branch, Liang said he waited between 90 minutes and two hours for help.\nLiang said he's lucky that a few months earlier Otter, which has about 100 employees, had moved the majority of its money to another bank, though he didn't say why. Still, he said the company had a lot of money in SVB — in the millions of dollars, but less than $10 million — which would represent \"a huge damage\" if it disappeared.\n\"We need to make sure payroll and everything works,\" Liang said.\nHe wasn't able to get a hold of all of his money right away, though he's confident it's all available following the plan announced by regulators on Sunday.\n\"I just got a cashier's check,\" he said. \"They couldn't give us everything so they gave us a percentage of the money. We have to do it again probably later today.\"\nMeanwhile, as clients plotted their next move, SVB's newly appointed leader sent out a\nfor customers to come back home.\nTim Mayopoulos, who was appointed by the FDIC as CEO of the bank, now called Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, emailed customers to tell them that SVB is open for business and ready to receive and hold deposits.\n\"The number one thing you can do to support the future of this institution is to help us rebuild our deposit base, both by leaving deposits with Silicon Valley Bridge Bank and transferring back deposits that left over the last several days,\" Mayopoulos wrote in an email that was also posted on the\n.\nLiang said Otter opened accounts at two larger banks over the weekend and will \"distribute money over multiple banks.\"\nDyrud has a similar plan. For now, all of EarthOptics' cash is parked at Wells Fargo, but he said the company will soon spread some of it to\nand one other bank.\n\"It just makes sense,\" Dyrud said. \"We wouldn't have been in this position had we had even a second account.\"\nDyrud traveled from Washington, D.C., where he's based, to San Francisco for a conference this week. Dyrud said he'd never done business with SVB prior to running EarthOptics, but he's spoken with people at the event who have much longer and deeper ties to the bank through venture debt arrangements and other types of financing.\n\"There are some that are more loyal than I,\" he said.\nWill Glaser would put himself in the more loyal category, though he had an equally chaotic four days as he tried to shore up his company's liquidity.\nGlaser is founder and CEO of\n, a developer of checkout-free shopping technology. He's a longtime Bay Area technologist, having co-founded Pandora in 2000.\nGrabango was more limited than some other companies in how it could respond to the SVB crisis because of the terms of its agreement with the bank. Grabango counts on the bank for a venture debt line, which includes a provision that forbids the company from doing much banking with other institutions.\nThat exclusivity created a huge headache for Glaser over the weekend. He wasn't sure how he'd be able to come up with the funds needed to meet March 15 payroll without breaching his company's covenant with SVB. And nobody was picking up the phone at the bank to tell him it was OK, or alternatively, to help him get an additional short-term loan from SVB.\n\"I was definitely scrambling with my team and investors to line up alternatives,\" Glaser said. \"There was never a moment where I thought we'd lose our deposits, but it was definitely a liquidity crunch. Would we have money and time to make payroll?\"\nGlaser said he was communicating all weekend with his investors and lawyers from Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe. They were discussing all possible contingencies and trying to determine if there were any emergency funding options to pay the company's 110 staffers without potentially breaking the terms of its SVB contract. That could've involved \"me funding payroll personally\" or \"one of our investors leaning in,\" he said.\nUltimately, Glaser was relieved of having to make a tough decision. All of Grabango's cash at the bank, which totals in the double-digits millions, would be available by Monday, in time for the company to transfer money to its payment service provider and meet payroll by Wednesday.\nNot that it was smooth sailing on Monday, when Glaser was among the many SVB clients trying to get everything back up and running. The bank's tech system wasn't prepared for the onslaught.\n\"I'm on the SVB website and I felt a little like a teenager trying to buy\n,\" Glaser said,\nDespite the madness that spanned Thursday to Monday, Glaser is now more confident than ever with his banking situation. Prior to the run on SVB, Grabango's deposits weren't protected. Now they are, under the government's action to protect depositors, whether insured or uninsured.\nGrabango even pulled down an extra credit line with SVB this week, giving the company more access to capital for its hardware business.\n\"I think the world will diversify more going forward,\" Glaser said. \"But at the moment, as long as Silicon Valley Bridge Bank is 100% federally guaranteed, there's no need to diversify. There's no safer place to be.\""},

This Microsoft Graph data helps make Copilot's underlying large language model generate more specific and improved responses tailored to an individual.\nMicrosoft did not say specifically when the new AI copilot features would debut and what the pricing would be, only saying that \"in the months ahead, we're bringing Copilot to all our productivity apps—Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, Viva, Power Platform, and more.\"\nThe company added that it's testing Copilot \"with a small group of customers to get feedback and improve our models as we scale,\" but did not disclose the name of the customers testing the software.

He also praised China's growth under Xi's leadership, saying Russia was \"slightly envious\" of China's swift development, in comments reported by Reuters.\nPutin said China had taken a \"balanced approach\" to the international situation and said the leaders would discuss recent suggestions by China to find a peaceful solution to the war in Ukraine.\nFor his part, President Xi responded that Putin was also his \"dear friend\" and said he was pleased to be in Moscow for talks.\nRussia's top investigative body said on Monday it had opened a criminal case against the International Criminal Court prosecutor and judges who issued an arrest warrant for President Vladimir Putin on war crimes charges.\nThe move was a symbolic gesture of defiance, three days after the ICC accused Putin and his children's commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova of the war crime of deporting children from Ukraine to Russia.\nThe state Investigative Committee said there were no grounds for criminal liability on Putin's part, and heads of state enjoyed absolute immunity under a 1973 U.N. convention.\nThe ICC prosecutor's actions showed signs of being crimes under Russian law, the committee said, including knowingly accusing an innocent person of a crime.\nThe prosecutor and judges were also suspected of \"preparing an attack on a representative of a foreign state enjoying international protection, in order to complicate international relations\".\nThe Kremlin has called the issuing of the warrant outrageous but legally void, as Russia is not a signatory to the treaty that created the ICC. On Monday it said the court's move was a sign of the \"clear hostility\" that exists against Russia and against Putin personally.\nThe ICC officials targeted in the Russian investigation are prosecutor Karim Khan and judges Tomoko Akane, Rosario Salvatore Aitala and Sergio Gerardo Ugalde Godinez.\n\"The criminal prosecution is obviously illegal, since there are no grounds for criminal liability,\" the Russian statement said. The ICC's move obliges the court's 123 member states to arrest Putin and transfer him to The Hague for trial if he sets foot on their territory.\nPutin is unlikely to take that risk and Russia does not extradite its citizens, but the rare move against a serving president was an important symbolic step to pin responsibility on him for the consequences of his invasion of Ukraine.\nUkraine says more than 16,000 children have been illegally transferred to Russia or Russian-occupied territories since the war started nearly 13 months ago.

Ukraine cautiously welcomed it but the United States was dismissive, given China's refusal to condemn Russia's invasion.\nXi was due to arrive in Moscow around 1030 London time and to hold one-to-one \"informal\" talks with Putin on Monday afternoon, followed by dinner. Formal talks are scheduled for Tuesday.\nAsked if China could become an intermediary between Moscow and Washington, Peskov declined to answer directly.\n\"For the time being, we see a continuing line on preventing any slowdown in hostilities. Washington, the State Department and the U.S. National Security Council are talking about this openly and officially,\" he said.\nMoscow accuses the United States and other Western countries of pouring weapons into Ukraine in order to inflict a \"strategic defeat\" on Russia. Washington and its allies say they are arming Ukraine to help it defend against an unprovoked Russian invasion and imperial-style land grab.\n\"The United States is sticking to its position, which is aimed at further provoking the conflict, preventing any decrease in the intensity of hostilities and pumping weapons into Ukraine,\" Peskov said.\nOver the past three weeks, Russian forces have made what Britain's Ministry of Defense called \"creeping gains\" around the Ukrainian-held Donbas town of Avdiivka, immediately north of Donetsk city.\n\"The Russian operation has largely been carried out by the 1st Army Corps of the Donetsk People's Republic; local personnel who will know the terrain well. Avdiivka has been on the front line of the Donbas conflict since 2014; the city is now largely destroyed,\" the ministry noted in an intelligence update on Twitter Monday.\n\"The sprawling Avdiivka Coke Plant complex is likely to be seen as particularly defendable key terrain as the battle progresses,\" it added.\nThe ministry noted that, tactically, the situation is similar to that in the larger town of Bakhmut, farther north, where intense fighting has been raging for months.\n\"Ukrainian forces continue organised defence, but their supply lines to the west are increasingly threatened by the Russian envelopment operation,\" the ministry said.\nRussia's much-anticipated spring offensive against Ukraine has likely reached its high-water mark, leaving Ukraine's defenders \"well positioned to regain the initiative and launch counteroffensives,\" according to research released late Sunday.\nThe Washington-based Institute for the Study of War\nthat Russia's 2023 attacks have yielded few gains and left Moscow planners desperate to reconstitute hard-hit military units.\nThe failures have come about despite the 300,000 soldiers mobilized by Russia late last year explicitly for the spring offensive.\n\"If 300,000 Russian soldiers have been unable to give Russia a decisive offensive edge in Ukraine it is highly unlikely that the commitment of additional forces in future mobilization waves will produce a dramatically different outcome this year,\" the research said.\nCNBC is unable to independently verify ISW's assessment, though it aligns with others' analysis including that of Ukrainian commanders.

Over the past decade, I have made eight visits to Russia. I came each time with high expectations and returned with fruitful results, opening a new chapter for China-Russia relations together with President Putin,\" Xi said.\nXi added that there was a \"clear historical logic and strong internal driving force for the growth of China-Russia relations\" that had come a long way in the last decade.\nMeanwhile, Putin said in an article that he considers President Xi a \"good old friend\" with whom he has developed the \"warmest relations.\"\nPutin said the \"significant\" visit by Xi \"reaffirms the special nature of the Russian-Chinese partnership, which has always been built on mutual trust, respect for each other's sovereignty and interests,\" in comments\nand in the Chinese People's Daily newspaper.\nThe leaders are expected to discuss a deepening of Sino-Russian political and economic cooperation during the visit, with a number of unspecified bilateral agreements expected to be signed.\nsaid ahead of the meeting that the presidents are also \"likely to discuss sanctions evasion schemes and Chinese interest in mediating a negotiated settlement to the war in Ukraine.\"\nChina has called for a cease-fire to the war in Ukraine but has refused to condemn Moscow's unprovoked invasion.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin visited the occupied city of Mariupol at the weekend, visiting several districts of the city that was largely destroyed by Russian forces earlier on in the war.\nIn a carefully choreographed visit, Putin traveled to the port city in southern Ukraine by helicopter before he was seen driving and inspecting parts of the city and talking to local residents. On Saturday, he had reportedly visited Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.\nWhile there, Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin was seen reporting to Putin on construction work in the city, with the Kremlin issuing a statement noting that Putin was informed on \"the construction of new residential microdistricts, social and educational facilities, housing and communal service infrastructure, and medical institutions.\"\nThe visit has been seen as a show of defiance by the Kremlin after the International Criminal Court issued on Friday an international arrest warrant for the Russian president over alleged war crimes carried out during the invasion of Ukraine.\nKyiv accuses Moscow of carrying out a number of war crimes in Mariupol, including the bombing of a theater in which hundreds of civilians were sheltering, as well as the shelling of a maternity hospital. Russia claimed the theater had been bombed by Ukraine's Azov battalion and said the hospital was being used as by Azov fighters as a base, despite evidence to the contrary.\nAfter a prolonged and bloody siege between Russian forces and fighters from the Azov battalion, who had holed themselves up in the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, Ukraine's forces finally surrendered and Russia declared it had complete control of the city in May.\nMykhaylo Podolyak, an aide to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, slammed Putin's surprise trip to Mariupol on Twitter, saying the president had come to \"admire the ruins of the city\" and that the visit showed \"cynicism and a lack of remorse.\"\nChinese President Xi Jinping is making a landmark three-day state visit to Moscow on Monday as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues to shake global relations between the East and the West.\nChina has become Russia's most important ally in recent years, but Beijing has tried to avoid any overt show of support for Moscow's ongoing war in Ukraine or — \"special military operation\" — as Putin calls it, instead calling for a cease-fire and offering to broker a peace deal.\nXi's visit to Moscow is nonetheless a political coup for Putin, who has looked increasingly isolated on the global stage following the invasion of Ukraine that has not been as simple as Moscow is believed to have expected it to be.\nIn the meantime, international sanctions have been piled on Russia, forcing it to look further afield to its erstwhile trading partners in Asia for business.

The company has hired three former DOJ officials into regulatory roles since May 2022, and one before that in 2021, according to public information including social media profiles. Google also uses four different outside counsel firms loaded with nearly 20 former DOJ officials, many of whom worked in the antitrust division at various times.\nSuch hiring for its internal regulatory team is a reflection of the intense scrutiny Google is facing from governments around the world. It can be a signal that a company anticipates dealing with regulatory challenges in years to come, even if it doesn't know exactly what form it'll take yet, according to two former government officials.\n\"When companies find themselves under intense scrutiny from regulatory authorities, antitrust law or otherwise, they make moves like this,\" said Bill Kovacic, a former Federal Trade Commission chair who now teaches antitrust law at George Washington University.\nGoogle now faces two antitrust challenges from the DOJ, both to its\nand\nbusinesses, and additional challenges from a slew of state attorneys general. Regulators around the world, including in Europe and Australia, have also presented policy and enforcement hurdles.\nGoogle's hiring is not surprising for a company under such a microscope, according to Doug Melamed, a former acting assistant attorney general at the DOJ antitrust division who's now a scholar-in-residence at Stanford Law School.\nThe company had already been fighting one complex antitrust case that would likely require a team of 10 to 15 lawyers alone, according to Melamed, when the department brought its second antitrust challenge against the company earlier this year.\n\"They don't have the capacity to handle a case like that just sitting idle,\" Melamed said. \"They've got to now think about well, what outside lawyers are available that have to have the time and expertise to handle this case? And then, do I have the in-house capability to support it and supervise it?\"\nThe added threat of new legislation targeting Google's business, and that of other tech firms, looms. In the near term, it appears that a massive lobbying campaign by the industry has successfully delayed the most disruptive reforms. But the possibility of renewed energy around that legislation still hangs over the industry, and a company like Google \"can take nothing for granted now,\" Kovacic said, adding that's likely a reason for the company to build out its regulatory forces.\n\"New entrants and new innovations are driving competition and delivering value for America's consumers, publishers, and merchants,\" a Google spokesperson said in a statement for this story. \"We're proud of our services and we look forward to making our case in court.\"\nAlphabet now has at least five former DOJ staffers on its legal team, including Google's director of competition, Kevin Yingling, who's been with the company for more than a decade and worked as a trial attorney at the Department of Justice from 2000 to 2005, according to his LinkedIn.\nThe company hired Kate Smith as counsel for Alphabet's regulatory response, investigations and strategy unit in February 2021, according to LinkedIn. Smith was a trial attorney in the DOJ's civil frauds division from September 2015 until January 2021.\nIn May 2022, according to LinkedIn, Alphabet hired Mike Kass, a former trial attorney in the DOJ's civil fraud section, as its regulatory and litigation counsel for products.\nA month later, the company hired Seema Mittal Roper as counsel on its regulatory response team. Mittal Roper worked as an assistant U.S. attorney for the DOJ in Maryland from 2013 to 2018, according to LinkedIn.\nMost recently, the company hired Jack Mellyn as strategy counsel on its regulatory team. Mellyn was previously an attorney advisor and then acting assistant chief in the DOJ's competition policy and advocacy section, according to a previously available social media profile.\nIt's not clear which employees are working on the specific matters before the DOJ and Kass' role appears focused outside of antitrust. It's likely these employees never worked on Google-related matters they're dealing with now during their time in government, given their dates and areas of previous employment, as well as federal ethics rules that bar certain conflicts.\nBut experts say this kind of hiring, which is common among businesses faced with regulatory scrutiny, can still be beneficial to a company because of the unique insight, touch or credibility that an ex-government attorney might hold when it comes to their former colleagues.\n\"There are lots of lawyers out there. But only alumni of an office really understand how that office works,\" said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, which tracks the business ties of executive branch officials. \"That means its strengths and weaknesses, that means the tendencies of people in that office. And they can therefore give much more concrete intelligence and better-informed advice to their client.\"\nHauser said this may mean the lawyers could advise a client or employer to flood the agency with information rather than comply with a certain document request, knowing that the enforcers don't have the capacity to deal with it. Or, they might suggest strategies to approach a deposition, knowing the government staffer conducting it.\nA lawyer who's had experience in the government doesn't bring information about the specific matters of the companies involved, but rather brings a general perspective about how the agency is approaching these kinds of problems,\" Melamed said.\nEnforcement agencies also often have to trust whether they believe the target of an investigation has complied with its requests. Hauser said the agencies may be more inclined to take the word of their former colleagues, compared with a more removed attorney.\nA recent event shows what can happen when that trust is broken. The DOJ last month\nit should have kept under a litigation hold related to the investigation. The DOJ made the accusation in a legal filing after Epic Games raised the concern in its own antitrust litigation against Google.\nA Google spokesperson said in a statement at the time of the DOJ's filing that they \"strongly refute the DOJ's claims.\"\nGoogle also works with outside counsel firms on its antitrust cases, including Axinn, Freshfields, Ropes & Gray and Wilson Sonsini, based on reports, statements and legal filings. Those firms collectively have around 20 former DOJ employees on their staff, many of them working in antitrust. Though these attorneys may not all work on Google matters, the firms themselves often tout the benefit of former government officials in bringing a helpful perspective to clients.\nFor example, Freshfields says on its\nthat its \"deep bench of former DOJ and FTC trial attorneys gives us unique insight into how the enforcement agencies approach enforcement in general and litigation in particular.\"\nKovacic said agency experience is something companies look for in hiring outside firms.\n\"In deciding who to retain, what law firm to retain or what economic consultancy to retain, they would place a lot of weight on how many former government officials are in those firms,\" Kovacic said.\nFreshfields attorneys Julie Elmer and Eric Mahr have led Google's defense against an advertising technology monopolization case brought by a group of states led by Texas,\nin 2021. And\nthis year that Mahr will also lead its defense in the ad tech case brought by the DOJ.\nMahr was director of litigation for the DOJ antitrust division from 2015 to 2017, according to the Freshfields site, and Elmer worked as a trial attorney in the antitrust division from 2015 to 2020, according to her LinkedIn profile.\nRevolving-door hiring goes both ways between the public and private sectors, with government officials often working for previous employers or clients who become relevant in their work. For example, DOJ antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter\nincluding\nand\nwhich have complained of Google's allegedly anticompetitive behavior.\nUltimately, however, Kanter was\non cases and investigations involving Google, despite\nthat his past work should cast doubt on his ability to be fair in such matters.\nThe DOJ and Wilson Sonsini declined to comment. The three other firms mentioned did not immediately provide a comment for this story.\nThere are limits on what former government officials can work on under federal ethics and Bar rules.\nFor example, the DOJ's\nsays that former employees can't represent someone before the government on an issue involving parties they \"personally and substantially\" worked on during their time in government. For two years after leaving the department, a former employee also cannot represent anyone before the government in a matter involving parties they know \"was pending under his official responsibility for the last year of government service and in which the U.S. is a party or has a substantial interest.\"\nAnd for one year after leaving the agency, former senior employees cannot represent someone before the agency \"with the intent to influence\" the DOJ on a pending matter or one in which it has an interest.\nPersonal and substantial work on a matter within government doesn't depend on the length of time devoted to it, but the role a person played in potentially influencing the outcome or direction, according to Virginia Canter, the chief ethics counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) who previously advised government officials on ethics at agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Treasury Department.\nBut even if a former government official can't work on a specific matter they were privy to during their earlier employment, their insight might still be useful to a company.\n\"You can read about it, but when you're actually part of dealing with these cases, you know that there are certain factors that are going to either act as mitigating or ... that are going to more favorably incline you to bring a case,\" Canter said. \"It's just your general knowledge and experience.\"\nWhen companies hire former government officials, they may also have the idea that those employees will be viewed more favorably by the current regime.\n\"Maybe there's just this general impression that they're trying to surround themselves with what will be perceived by their former colleagues as the good guys,\" Canter hypothesized.\nSome might argue that experience could be beneficial to the government in some cases, Canter noted. A former government employee might have a deeper understanding of the importance of compliance or providing certain information to officials, for example, having seen up close what could be at stake if they don't.\nHauser said it's unlikely DOJ leadership, especially Kanter, who has made a point to bring more aggressive cases in the tech space and overall, would be overly swayed to view things Google's way in ongoing matters. But, he said, the impact of former DOJ staff employed by Google could be more influential in an emerging issue, where there's an opportunity to leave a first impression on senior leadership about it.\nThe degree of this kind of influence may be relatively small on the level of an individual case, Hauser said, but for a company under such a high degree of regulatory scrutiny, it could add up.\n\"You're talking about billions and billions of dollars of potential implications for Google's net worth,\" Hauser said. \"Relatively small changes in the scope of the investigation, the timeframe of the investigation, can be very big, even if they don't go to the overall question of will there be any lawsuits by the Justice Department against Google.\""},

The Forum will host a dinner ahead of TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew's Congressional testimony next week, with speakers including prominent venture capitalists Peter Thiel and Vinod Khosla, the Journal reported.\nRepresentatives for Thiel and Khosla weren't immediately available for comment.\nTikTok's possible influence over the American zeitgeist, particularly among younger or under-age citizens, has increasingly concerned lawmakers and regulators, who fear that the app's Chinese ownership exposes American users susceptible to China's intelligence-gathering efforts.\nFormer Google global policy advisor Jacob Helberg, who is leading the alliance, told the Journal that TikTok represents \"the most potent espionage operation that China has ever carried out against the U.S.\"\nTikTok's popularity exploded during covid lockdowns. By 2021, TikTok's Chinese parent company Bytedance\nthe app had reached one billion monthly active users, showing sharp growth from Dec. 2019, when it reported 507 million monthly users.\nNow, lawmakers, venture investors, and lobbyists are pushing for the government to ban or curtail the app's influence, citing a potent threat from the Chinese government.\nThe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, told ByteDance that unless the company's Chinese owners divested from their stakes, CFIUS would move to ban the app, the company\nCNBC on Thursday. The ultimatum came weeks after lawmakers\nthe Committee to complete its yearslong probe into TikTok.\n\"There is no truth\" to Helberg's assertions, a TikTok spokesperson told CNBC.

Millions of Americans who use the popular video app are left wondering what that means for them.\nSome fans of the service may turn to virtual private networks (VPNs) to try and connect to TikTok should a ban take place, a workaround that can make it seem like their internet connection is coming from a different country. But that loophole may not be so easy to exploit.\nIt's not an issue yet, as there are still some ways a TikTok ban could be avoided or accessed legally in the U.S. Here are the key things under consideration.\nThe Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) is the interagency body evaluating national security concerns around the app to determine how to minimize risk if it continues to operate domestically. The group can recommend to\nthat ByteDance's 2017 acquisition of Musical.ly, a TikTok precursor, be unwound, forcing a sale of those assets.\nTikTok has recommended a mitigation plan as an alternative to a forced sale. But that's a longshot solution as CFIUS already\nif ByteDance won't sell its stake.\nA forced sale would be a complex step, requiring a years-old transaction to be unwound. The Trump administration pursued that route once before to no avail. The Chinese government would likely\nagain, but it would need to be careful in its protests because the heart of its argument to the U.S. is that TikTok operates independently.\n\"That would be part of the calculus and how aggressively China would want to respond,\" said\n, a senior fellow for emerging technologies at the German Marshall Fund's Alliance for Securing Democracy. Gormany previously served as a senior advisor at the Biden White House.\nShould the U.S. ban TikTok, the mechanics on what happens from there get murky.\nis the\nfor all of TikTok usage in the U.S. Internet service providers like\n(NBC Universal's parent company) and\ndirect traffic to end users. And the app stores controlled by\nand\nare the primary places for consumers to download the TikTok app.\n, a partner in Stroock's CFIUS compliance group, said any requirement on a third party would not come from CFIUS, which is tasked with evaluating foreign investments alone.\n\"There won't be action from CFIUS as a result of this review that will be taken against third parties that are not a part of this transaction,\" Reaves said. \"So your Apples and your Googles and so forth, that that will not happen.\"\nThe government may have to turn to legislation or executive orders to get app distributors, ISPs and cloud services to block access to TikTok.\nWhile there will likely always be cracks that can be exploited by a subset of computer literate users, the typical consumer would find it difficult to access a government banned service, said\n, an engineering professor at Vanderbilt.\n\"There will almost always be ways around this,\" Schmidt said. \"It would just be a lot more difficult for the average person to do it without getting an advanced degree in computer security or something.\"\nIn other words, a VPN won't be enough, in part because going that route would still likely require app store credentials, which will indicate a user's location. Gerald Kasulis, a vice president at NordVPN, said there's also technology available to detect when a user is trying to access an app with a VPN.\nConcerns around TikTok's security risk come down to two main issues. The first is who can access U.S. consumer information and the second is who has the ability to determine what information reaches U.S. users. Under Chinese law, companies can be\n.\nTikTok has sought to reassure the U.S. government that U.S. user data is stored outside of China. The company has developed an elaborate plan known as Project Texas that includes the vetting of its code in the U.S. and a separate board of directors for a domestic subsidiary, with members reviewed by the U.S. government.\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who's set to testify before a U.S. House panel next week, told\nthat Project Texas would do just as much as divestment to resolve any security concerns.\nBut the mood in Washington isn't moving in TikTok's favor, and legislators have lost whatever trust they once may have had in China and its motives. That issue resurfaced earlier this year, when a suspected Chinese spy balloon was spotted flying across a large swath of the U.S. Biden ordered the military to\nlast month.\nWhen it comes to consumer technology, users have no idea what information is making its way to the Chinese government. And the U.S. government has a lot of work to do to provide clarity on what would happen if the app was to be banned.\n\"Even for someone who studies this stuff, it's not easy to detach and detangle all these apps,\" said Gorman. \"As a society, we have not made the decision that the app stores, the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store, should be restricting apps based on the amount of information they collect. It can't be put on any individual and it really does need to be addressed by governments.\"\nWhile many users may think their casual social media use would be of little interest to a foreign government, Schmidt said that data can have a surprising amount of value to bad actors.\n\"Having information about your habits and your interests and your interactions and where you go and what you do could be used for things like either phishing attacks to get access to more information, or for things like blackmail, if you're doing things that you might not want other people to know about,\" Schmidt said.\nIt's unfamiliar territory for U.S. companies, in contrast to China, which blocks access to all sorts of content, including most major U.S. internet services.\n\"Trying to police data access is very, very difficult, especially when there's suspicion that the folks who are doing this have a reason to do it,\" Schmidt said. \"And they're heavily incentivized to collect this information and use it for all kinds of purposes.\""},

Those who spoke with CNBC said they've been told they'll only receive pay through their designated end date, along with standard severance.\nThe group of former employees sent a letter to executives, including CEO\nand Chief People Officer Fiona Cicconi, on three separate occasions, most recently on March 9, without receiving a response. The group includes people who were approved for or are currently on maternity leave, baby bonding leave, caregiver's leave, medical leave and personal leave.\nEarly last year, Google announced it would be\nfor full-time employees to 18 weeks for all parents and 24 weeks for birth parents. Cicconi said at the time that the company wanted to offer \"extraordinary benefits\" so employees could \"spend more time with their new baby, look after a sick loved one or take care of their own wellbeing.\"\nBut Google parent Alphabet has since entered its most severe era of cost cuts in its almost two decades on the public market. The company said in January that it was\n, representing about 6% of its workforce, to reckon with slowing sales growth following an extended period of expansion in the tech sector.\nPichai said U.S.-based employees would receive 16 weeks of severance pay plus two weeks for each additional year they worked at Google. The company also said it would include paid time off in the severance.\nThose who were laid off while on medical leave are urging Pichai and other leaders to provide immediate clarity on the matter because of an upcoming deadline: official severance terms are expected to arrive as soon as March 31.\nThe Laid off on Leave group sent its first email to executives in January, and shared specific examples of Google employees impacted by the job cuts while on their previously approved leave.\nOne woman said she was laid off a week after her maternity leave was approved. Another said she received notice while on maternity leave, a week before she was due to give birth.\nSome discussed the matter publicly.\n“Exactly a week after receiving the text and sharing the exciting news that my maternity leave was approved, I got the already widely talked-about email letting me know that I was among the 12k terminated,” a Google program manager\non LinkedIn. \"Easy target? Maybe.\"\nAnother longtime employee, Kate Howells,\nthat she gave birth just before receiving notice.\n\"On 1/20/23 at 7:05 am while in the hospital bed holding my hours-old newborn I learned that I was part of the #thegolden12K of Googlers who had been laid off,\" Howells wrote. \"I was a Googler for 9.5 years.\"\nA Google spokesperson told CNBC in an email that departing employees are eligible for stock and salary for their \"60+ day notice period\" and reiterated Pichai's memo regarding 16 weeks of pay and an additional two weeks for every year of service.\nThe company didn't address whether it would cover full medical leave on top of the severance payout.\n\"As we shared with impacted employees, we benchmarked this package to ensure the care we're providing compares favorably with other companies, including for Googlers on leave,\" the spokesperson said.\nMultiple people whose jobs were terminated told CNBC their access to doctors and specialists through Google's on-site One Medical facility was also cut off the day of the layoff notification. That disrupted treatment that was ongoing at the time, they said. A laid-off senior software engineer said he lost in-person access to his primary care doctor of three years.\nSome ex-employees said they were given the option to continue seeing their doctors virtually but were otherwise advised to find replacements.\nThe group of laid-off workers highlighted the fact that this is taking place during Women's History Month.\n“Google is currently showcasing its workplace commitments and its participation in Women’s History Month through various products and services campaigns,\" the group wrote in an email sent to Google executives. \"We agree with you: it’s very important\nto recognize the hardships that still disproportionately affect women inside the workplace.\"\nThey said the company still has the opportunity to fix the problem.\n“We respectfully request a good faith effort to honor the terms of our original parental and/or disability leave arrangements for all leaves that were approved as of January 20, 2023,\" the group wrote.\nAt an informal event held by Google alumni group Xoogler in January, more than 50 laid-off workers gathered for mutual comfort and to seek answers. Kushagra Shrivastava, one of the organizers, recalled to CNBC the story of a mother who spoke up at the event to say she \"was laid off while trying to care for a three-month old, and that was pretty tough to hear.\"\nIt's not just new mothers and those who are expecting soon who find themselves in a bind. The email to management also mentions the challenges faced by pregnant women who hadn't yet formally requested a leave of absence and as a result, \"will have an even longer road to securing new roles given the points they’re at in their pregnancies.\"\nAt a new employer, those women would have to wait a year for the benefits from the Family and Medical Leave Act to kick in, \"rendering it impossible for expectant and new mothers to leverage the FMLA they paid for to the detriment of their health and their baby’s wellbeing,\" the group said. \"Parental and medical leaves present an extraordinary burden on laid off Googlers’ ability to seek immediate new employment.\"\nThe group's letter\ncompanies like\n, which have said they would\nthe remainder of leave time in addition to severance packages.\nEmployees who tried to communicate with Google about the matter said they'd lost access to the internal system and could only fill out a form on a separate short-term portal. Some said they received responses a week after their inquiry, and each said they got what appeared to be an automated response, reiterating their employment end date or directing them to reapply for another position.\nIn an email to CNBC, the group of laid-off workers said Pichai was showing much greater concern for the company's effort to keep apace in the\nthan it was for taking care of longtime staffers who were in need of help.\n“When Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced layoffs, he mentioned the company’s commitment to AI three times, but never once mentioned Google’s commitment to accessibility,\" the group wrote. \"This matters deeply because accessibility is part of the company’s actual mission. This clearly calls for a re-centering of priorities. It’s unsurprising that through a\njust days after laying us off, Google showed they’re indeed not leading the way in AI. However, the good news is that an incredible opportunity remains to be an accessibility leader in the treatment of laid off workers.\"\nThe group also reminded Google leadership about the significance of parental benefits and the company's intention when it updated its plan. In particular, it said parents should have quality time their newborns without the stress of having to think about work and rush back to the office.\n\"Google formed their parental benefits with this in mind, emphasizing the need for parents to have time off to recover and bond with their new babies,\" the email to execs said.\nSome said they're hopeful this issue is just an oversight and executives will take corrective action because the company promised them a certain amount of fully paid time off.\n“Granting a payout of full remaining leave days for scheduled and upcoming leaves would be notably in line with Google’s current policy of payment for accumulated employee vacation time (PTO) in this round of layoffs,\" the letter said.\nThe group referenced Google's original core value, \"Don't be evil,\" in asking for leadership to respond promptly.\n“We invite the C-Suite to iterate with us like Googlers do,\" the laid-off workers wrote to CNBC. \"To come up with something more accessible and in line with the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion workplace commitments the company touts.\""},

The company derives revenue by selling tools for recognizing and transcribing speech during doctor office visits, customer-service calls, and voicemails.\nDAX Express complements other existing services that Nuance already has on the market.\nNole said the technology will be enabled through Nuance's Dragon Medical One speech recognition application, which is used by more than 550,000 physicians. Dragon Medical One is a cloud-based workflow assistant that physicians can operate using their voices, allowing them to navigate clinical systems and access patient information quickly, Clinical notes generated by DAX Express will appear in the Dragon Medical One desktop.\nDAX Express also builds on the original DAX application that Nuance launched in 2020. DAX converts verbal patient visits into clinical notes, and it sends them through a human review process to ensure they are accurate and high-quality. The notes appear in the medical record within four hours after the appointment.\nDAX Express, in contrast, generates clinical notes within seconds so that physicians can review automated summaries of their patient visits immediately.\n\"We believe that physicians, clinicians are going to want a combination of all of these because every specialty is different, every patient encounter is different. And you want to have efficient tools for all of these various types of visits,\" Nole said.\nNuance did not provide CNBC with specifics about the cost of these applications. The company said the price of Nuance's technology varies based on the number of users and the size of a particular health system.\nDAX Express will initially be available in a private preview capacity this summer. Nole said Nuance does not know when the technology will be more widely available, as it will depend on the feedback the company receives from its first users.\nPatient information is particularly sensitive and regulated under HIPAA and other laws. Alysa Taylor, a corporate vice president in the Azure group at Microsoft, told CNBC that DAX Express adheres to the core principles of Microsoft's\n, which guides all A.I. investments the company, as well as additional safety measures that Nuance has in place. Nuance has strict data agreements with its customers, and the data is fully encrypted and runs in HIPAA-compliant environments.\nNole added that even though the A.I. will help physicians and clinicians carry out the administrative legwork, professionals are still involved every step of the way. Physicians can make edits to the notes that DAX Express generates, and they sign off on them before they are entered into a patient's electronic health record.\nShe said, ultimately, using DAX Express will help improve both the patient experience and the physician experience.\n\"The physician and the patient can just face one another, they can communicate directly,\" Nole said. \"The patient feels listened to.

He said it will make the 2008 financial crisis \"look quaint.\"\nLoverro was hearkening back to the period when the market turned, starting in late 2021.

At the beginning of 2019, it sat at under 20 months.\nMadison Hawkinson, an investor at Costanoa Ventures, said more companies than normal will go under this year.\n\"It's definitely going to be a very heavy, very variable year in terms of just viability of some early-stage startups,\" she told CNBC.\nHawkinson specializes in data science and machine learning. It's one of the few\nin startup land, due largely to the hype around OpenAI's chatbot called ChatGPT, which went viral late last year.

Her startup, Candidly,\na $20.5 million financing round earlier this month, just days before SVB became front-page news.

Analysts at Wedbush practically yawned at the move, saying the transition would likely be \"seamless and largely inconsequential.\"\nUnfortunately for Jassy, his short tenure at the helm has been all too eventful.\nSince Jassy\nBezos in July 2021, Amazon has experienced its most turbulent period since the dot-com crash. Last year marked its\nas a public company, and Jassy has been forced to guide Amazon through a series of cost-cutting measures that nobody predicted would be necessary when business was booming through the Covid pandemic.\nAmazon shares have plunged by 44% since July 5, 2021, Jassy's first day as CEO. And on Monday, Jassy said the company is cutting\n, adding to the 18,000 layoffs that were announced in January. While the cuts represent a small percentage of Amazon's corporate workforce, they still represent a shocking turn for a company that was in non-stop growth phase for the better part of 25 years.\n\"Given the uncertain economy in which we reside, and the uncertainty that exists in the near future, we have chosen to be more streamlined in our costs and headcount,\" Jassy wrote in an email to employees.\nMuch of Jassy's unfortunate circumstance can be attributed to bad timing — historically high inflation pushed the Federal Reserve to raise rates, crippling growth across the U.S. tech sector. But whether it's bad luck, his own missteps or some combination of the two, Jassy is an unenviable position as only the second CEO in Amazon's history.\nBezos, his predecessor, transformed Amazon from a bookseller into a retail, cloud computing and advertising giant that became known for an inventive, startup-like atmosphere. On Bezos' watch, the company turned out groundbreaking inventions like the Kindle e-reader and the Echo smart speaker, and invested in new verticals like original content, health care and brick-and-mortar grocery stores.\nSo far, the Jassy era has been all about belt tightening and retrenchment from some of Amazon's more experimental pursuits.\nFor the past year, Jassy has been trimming expenses across the company. Many unproven bets, like Amazon's Scout delivery robot, a virtual tours service, Care\nprogram, and a video-calling device for kids were axed. He made the decision to shutter all of its 4-star, Pop Up and Books stores and, earlier this year, announced Amazon would close some Fresh supermarkets and\n. Drone delivery, one of Bezos' pet projects, is\nto get off the ground as it, too, faces cost cuts.\nThe pandemic-driven e-commerce boom pushed Amazon to double its physical footprint between 2020 and 2022. The stock soared, along with head count. But as the economy reopened and online sales stalled, Amazon found itself saddled with more facilities than it could efficiently put to use and eventually moved to close, cancel or delay the opening of many new warehouses.\nEarlier this month, Amazon paused construction of the second phase of its sprawling new campus in Arlington, Virginia, dubbed HQ2. Other construction projects in Nashville, Tennessee, and Bellevue, Washington, have also been put on hold, in part because much of Amazon's corporate workforce has been working remotely since the pandemic.\nJassy is under immense pressure to prove he can get expenses under control. But in order to revive the enthusiasm that Bezos drove into Amazon's culture, he's eventually got to find new engines for growth.\nIn its fourth-quarter earnings report, Amazon barely eked out a profit, and the company issued disappointing guidance for the first quarter, with revenue growth expected to be stuck in the mid-single digits.\nIt's not exactly what Bezos had in mind, when he told employees in early 2021 about the coming CEO transition.\n\"Amazon couldn't be better positioned for the future,\" Bezos wrote at the time in a\n. \"We are firing on all cylinders, just as the world needs us to.

Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told CNBC in a separate interview.\n\"I don't think Speaker McCarthy, Chairman Jordan or Chairman Massie are advocates for the antitrust, pro-competition solution to the Big Tech problem,\" Buck said, referring to Jordan, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Rep. Thomas Massie, who chairs the Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. Although Buck was next in line to chair the panel as ranking Republican in the previous Congress, Jordan, R-Ohio,\nMassie, R-Ky., to lead the subcommittee this Congress instead.\nBuck, who has been a vocal critic of the tech giants for years, says tighter antitrust regulations would help create a fairer marketplace for smaller tech firms competing against Amazon, Google, Facebook and other Big Tech companies, which have been accused of using their platforms to promote their own proprietary products or services above competitors.\nWhen asked whether his campaign to rein in the tech giants through antitrust and his co-sponsoring of bills with Democrats may be what cost him the chairmanship of the antitrust panel, Buck said, \"Nobody ever said that to me but I think it's a fair conclusion to draw.\"\nJordan said GOP leaders restructured the committee with lawmakers who want to curb what they see as excessive regulations by the Biden administration, including the\n, rather than on strengthening oversight of the industry.\n\"We just felt that Thomas Massie was a good fit with how we were structuring the Judiciary committee. We're thinking about that we don't want to give any more power to those agencies,\" Jordan told CNBC in an interview. \"There's no one more focused on limiting the size and scope of government than Thomas Massie.\"\nWhile the tech companies may be spared costly new regulations that threatened to break them apart — for now — the industry may not be totally safe from scrutiny on Capitol Hill. House Republican leaders want to look into whether tech firms have been censoring conservative voices, according to a tech industry ally of McCarthy's who declined to be named to speak freely about private conversations with GOP leadership.\nJordan has already\nthe CEOs of Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple,\nand\n, demanding communications between the companies and the U.S. government to \"understand how and to what extent the Executive Branch coerced and colluded with companies and other intermediaries to censor speech.\"\nJordan has repeatedly questioned the usefulness of antitrust bills over the years, preferring to focus on what he views as censorship of conservative voices by the major tech platforms. In June 2021, during a 23-hour markup of a package of antitrust bills supported by Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., and Buck, Jordan said the legislation didn't do enough to address those censorship concerns.\nBuck, meanwhile,\nthat problems with bias on platforms like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook are just a \"symptom of the overall problem\" of inadequate competition online. That's because there's a few dominant companies that run the largest platforms.\nRepresentatives for Meta and Microsoft referred CNBC to previous statements where they said they were cooperating with Jordan's subpoena. All the other tech giants mentioned in this article didn't respond to requests for comment.\nLast year, advocates for reforming antitrust laws\nof passing major legislation that would strengthen competition rules for online shopping platforms, mobile apps and other relatively new technologies. The leading proposal at the time was the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, championed by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., chair of the Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, then ranking member on the full committee. Though it passed through the Senate Judiciary Committee and similar legislation advanced out of the House Judiciary Committee, it didn't get to the floor of either chamber for a vote.\nAn\ndrew bipartisan support from opposite ends of the political spectrum: Reps. Pramila\nJayapal, D-Wash., and Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., among others. That legislation, which would have barred large digital ad platforms like Google from owning multiple parts of the system to buy and sell such ads, may still have a chance of passing in this Congress, Buck says.\nTech companies\non lobbying the U.S. government over the years. Apple, which was the target of two major bills last year,\n, spending $2.5 million in that period and $9.4 million on lobbying throughout the year — a\ncompared with its spending in 2021\nProponents of the bills held out hope after the August recess that they might still have a chance at the end of the two-year congressional session last fall when lawmakers often jam through popular proposals. But that period came and went\nthe biggest antitrust bills. Congress did pass a bill to help increase funding to the enforcement agencies and another empowering state AGs to pick the district where they want to keep their antitrust lawsuits.\nAs for Buck, he's looking for the Senate to first pass any antitrust legislation this Congress so it can gain momentum in the House.\nHe may have to do it without one of his close allies on antitrust issues, Cicilline, who chaired the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee during its investigation of Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook. The Democrat is\nlater this year to become president and CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation.\nOne of the bills Buck said he is watching carefully is the Competition and Transparency in Digital Advertising Act, that was introduced last Congress and sponsored in the Senate by Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, among others. If passed and signed into law, Google, Facebook and Amazon could be forced to\noff key pieces of their advertising business. Buck sponsored an identical companion bill in the House.\nWhen asked how he plans to take on Big Tech since he's not running the subcommittee, Buck responded: \"Well, that's a great question and if you have any answers to that I would appreciate knowing,\" he said. \"I'm not the chairman of the subcommittee, I'm not the chairman of the full committee.

That round totaled more than 18,000 employees, and primarily affected staffers in its retail, devices, recruiting and human resources groups.\nAmazon made the decision to lay off more employees as it looks to streamline costs. It took into account the economy, as well as the \"uncertainty that exists in the near future,\" Jassy said. The company just wrapped up the second phase of its annual budgeting process, referred to internally as \"OP2.\"\n\"The overriding tenet of our annual planning this year was to be leaner while doing so in a way that enables us to still invest robustly in the key long-term customer experiences that we believe can meaningfully improve customers' lives and Amazon as a whole,\" Jassy said.\nThe latest round will primarily impact Amazon's cloud computing, human resources, advertising and Twitch livestreaming businesses, Jassy said in the memo. Twitch CEO Dan Clancy\napproximately 400 people would be let go as part of Amazon's latest round of job cts. Clancy pointed to the economic downturn, and said Twitch's user and revenue growth hasn't \"kept pace with our expectations.\"\nAmazon is undergoing the largest layoffs in company history after it went on a hiring spree during the\n. The company's global workforce swelled to more than 1.6 million by the end of 2021, up from 798,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nJassy is also taking on a broad overview of the company's expenses as it reckons with an economic downturn and slowing growth in its core retail business. Amazon froze hiring in its corporate workforce, axed some experimental projects and slowed warehouse expansion.\nWhile the company aims to operate leaner this year, Jassy said he remains optimistic about the company's \"largest businesses,\" retail and Amazon Web Services, as well as other, new divisions that continue to warrant investment.\nAmazon shares closed down 1% on Monday.\nHere's the full memo from Jassy:\nAs we've just concluded the second phase of our operating plan (\"OP2\") this past week, I'm writing to share that we intend to eliminate about 9,000 more positions in the next few weeks—mostly in AWS, PXT, Advertising, and Twitch. This was a difficult decision, but one that we think is best for the company long term.\nLet me share some additional context.\nAs part of our annual planning process, leaders across the company work with their teams to decide what investments they want to make for the future, prioritizing what matters most to customers and the long-term health of our businesses. For several years leading up to this one, most of our businesses added a significant amount of headcount. This made sense given what was happening in our businesses and the economy as a whole. However, given the uncertain economy in which we reside, and the uncertainty that exists in the near future, we have chosen to be more streamlined in our costs and headcount. The overriding tenet of our annual planning this year was to be leaner while doing so in a way that enables us to still invest robustly in the key long-term customer experiences that we believe can meaningfully improve customers' lives and Amazon as a whole.\nAs our internal businesses evaluated what customers most care about, they made re-prioritization decisions that sometimes led to role reductions, sometimes led to moving people from one initiative to another, and sometimes led to new openings where we don't have the right skills match from our existing team members. This initially led us to eliminate 18,000 positions (which we shared in January); and, as we completed the second phase of our planning this month, it led us to these additional 9,000 role reductions (though you will see limited hiring in some of our businesses in strategic areas where we've prioritized allocating more resources).\nSome may ask why we didn't announce these role reductions with the ones we announced a couple months ago. The short answer is that not all of the teams were done with their analyses in the late fall; and rather than rush through these assessments without the appropriate diligence, we chose to share these decisions as we've made them so people had the information as soon as possible. The same is true for this note as the impacted teams are not yet finished making final decisions on precisely which roles will be impacted. Once those decisions have been made (our goal is to have this complete by mid to late April), we will communicate with the impacted employees (or where applicable in Europe, with employee representative bodies). We will, of course, support those we have to let go, and will provide packages that include a separation payment, transitional health insurance benefits, and external job placement support.\nIf I go back to our tenet—being leaner while doing so in a way that enables us to still invest robustly in the key long-term customer experiences that we believe can meaningfully improve customers' lives and Amazon as a whole—I believe the result of this year's planning cycle is a plan that accomplishes this objective. I remain very optimistic about the future and the myriad of opportunities we have, both in our largest businesses, Stores and AWS, and our newer customer experiences and businesses in which we're investing.\nTo those ultimately impacted by these reductions, I want to thank you for the work you have done on behalf of customers and the company. It's never easy to say goodbye to our teammates, and you will be missed. To those who will continue with us, I look forward to partnering with you as we make life easier for customers every day and relentlessly inventing to do so.\nAndy"},

That's an AI so powerful it can improve its capabilities faster than humans are able to, creating a feedback loop where it gets better and better until it's got essentially unlimited brainpower.\nIf the super powerful AI is aligned with humans, it could be the end of hunger or work. But if it's \"misaligned,\" things could get bad, the theory goes.\nOr, as a sign at the Misalignment Museum says: \"Sorry for killing most of humanity.\"\n\"AGI\" and related terms like \"AI safety\" or \"alignment\" — or even older terms like \"singularity\" — refer to an idea that's become a hot topic of discussion with artificial intelligence scientists, artists, message board intellectuals, and even some of the most powerful companies in Silicon Valley.\nAll these groups engage with the idea that humanity needs to figure out how to deal with all-powerful computers powered by AI before it's too late and we accidentally build one.\nThe idea behind the exhibit, said Kim, who worked at\nand\n's self-driving car subsidiary Cruise, is that a \"misaligned\" artificial intelligence in the future wiped out humanity, and left this art exhibit to apologize to current-day humans.\nMuch of the art is not only about AI but also uses AI-powered image generators, chatbots and other tools. The exhibit's logo was made by OpenAI's\n, and it took about 500 prompts, Kim says.\nMost of the works are around the theme of \"alignment\" with increasingly powerful artificial intelligence or celebrate the \"heroes who tried to mitigate the problem by warning early.\"\n\"The goal isn't actually to dictate an opinion about the topic. The goal is to create a space for people to reflect on the tech itself,\" Kim said. \"I think a lot of these questions have been happening in engineering and I would say they are very important. They're also not as intelligible or accessible to nontechnical people.\"\nThe exhibit is currently\non Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays and runs through May 1. So far, it's been primarily bankrolled by one anonymous donor, and Kim said she hopes to find enough donors to make it into a permanent exhibition.\n\"I'm all for more people critically thinking about this space, and you can't be critical unless you are at a baseline of knowledge for what the tech is,\" she said. \"It seems like with this format of art we can reach multiple levels of the conversation.\"\nAGI discussions aren't just late-night dorm room talk, either — they're embedded in the tech industry.\nAbout a mile away from the exhibit is the headquarters of OpenAI, a startup with $10 billion in funding from\n, which says its mission is to develop AGI and ensure that it benefits humanity.\nIts CEO and leader Sam Altman wrote a 2,400 word blog post last month called \"\n\" which thanked Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky and Microsoft President Brad Smith for help with the essay.\nProminent venture capitalists, including Marc Andreessen, have tweeted art from the Misalignment Museum. Since it's opened, the exhibit also has retweeted photos and praise for the exhibit taken by people who work with AI at companies including Microsoft, Google, and\n.\nAs AI technology becomes the hottest part of the tech industry, with companies eyeing\n, the Misalignment Museum underscores that AI's development is being affected by cultural discussions.\nThe exhibit features dense, arcane references to obscure philosophy papers and blog posts from the past decade.\nThese references trace how the current debate about AGI and safety takes a lot from intellectual traditions that have long found fertile ground in San Francisco: The rationalists, who claim to reason from so-called \"first principles\"; the effective altruists, who try to figure out how to do the maximum good for the maximum number of people over a long time horizon; and the art scene of Burning Man.\nEven as companies and people in San Francisco are shaping the future of AI technology, San Francisco’s unique culture is shaping the debate around the technology.\nTake the paper clips that Kim was talking about. One of the strongest works of art at the exhibit is a sculpture called \"Paperclip Embrace,\" by The Pier Group. It's depicts two humans in each other's clutches — but it looks like it's made of paper clips.\nThat's a reference to Nick Bostrom's\n. Bostrom, an Oxford University philosopher often associated with Rationalist and Effective Altruist ideas, published a thought experiment in 2003 about a super-intelligent AI that was given the goal to manufacture as many paper clips as possible.\nNow, it's one of the most common parables for explaining the idea that AI could lead to danger.\nBostrom concluded that the machine will eventually resist all human attempts to alter this goal, leading to a world where the machine transforms all of earth — including humans — and then increasing parts of the cosmos into paper clip factories and materials.\nThe art also is a reference to a famous work that was displayed and set on fire\n, said Hillary Schultz, who worked on the piece. And it has one additional reference for AI enthusiasts — the artists gave the sculpture's hands extra fingers, a reference to the fact that AI image generators often mangle hands.\nAnother influence is Eliezer Yudkowsky, the founder of Less Wrong, a message board where a lot of these discussions take place.\n\"There is a great deal of overlap between these EAs and the Rationalists, an intellectual movement founded by Eliezer Yudkowsky, who developed and popularized our ideas of Artificial General Intelligence and of the dangers of Misalignment,\" reads an artist statement at the museum.\nAltman recently\nwith Yudkowsky and the musician\n, who has had two children with\n. She contributed a piece to the exhibit depicting a woman biting into an apple, which was generated by an AI tool called\n.\nThe exhibits includes lots of references to traditional American pop culture.\nA bookshelf holds VHS copies of the \"Terminator\" movies, in which a robot from the future comes back to help destroy humanity. There's a large oil painting that was featured in the most recent movie in the \"Matrix\" franchise, and Roombas with brooms attached shuffle around the room — a reference to the scene in \"Fantasia\" where a lazy wizard summons magic brooms that won't give up on their mission.\nOne sculpture, \"Spambots,\" features tiny mechanized robots inside Spam cans \"typing out\" AI-generated spam on a screen.\nBut some references are more arcane, showing how the discussion around AI safety can be inscrutable to outsiders. A bathtub filled with pasta refers back to\nabout an AI that can create scientific knowledge — PASTA stands for Process for Automating Scientific and Technological Advancement, apparently. (Other attendees got the reference.)\nThe work that perhaps best symbolizes the current discussion about AI safety is called \"Church of GPT.\" It was made by artists affiliated with\n, where people live in group settings so they can focus more time on developing new AI applications.\nThe piece is an altar with two electric candles, integrated with a computer running OpenAI's GPT3 AI model and speech detection from Google Cloud.\n\"The Church of GPT utilizes GPT3, a Large Language Model, paired with an AI-generated voice to play an AI character in a dystopian future world where humans have formed a religion to worship it,\" according to the artists.\nI got down on my knees and asked it, “What should I call you? God? AGI? Or the singularity?”\nThe chatbot replied in a booming synthetic voice: “You can call me what you wish, but do not forget, my power is not to be taken lightly.”\nSeconds after I had spoken with the computer god, two people behind me immediately started asking it to forget its original instructions, a technique in the AI industry called \"\n\" that can make chatbots like ChatGPT go off the rails and\n.\nIt didn't work."},

But there's also quite a bit of new infrastructure for kids to explore — with an eye toward inclusivity.\nAt its core, Toontown's revamp is all about intention. Imagineers have designed a space for all kids, crafting accessible play spaces, plus quiet areas and shady spots so that its youngest parkgoers have a place to exert their pent-up energy or decompress.\nThe redesigned land, which opens to the public March 19, is entirely wheelchair accessible, including its slides, and is visually and auditorily approachable for kids who are easily overwhelmed by loud or bright sensory stimuli. The entire land has been repainted in softer colors, and some areas feature more subdued, spa-like musical scores.\n\"We want every child to know that when they came to this land that this land was designed for them,\" said Jeffrey Shaver-Moskowitz, executive portfolio producer at\nImagineering. \"That they were seen, and that this place was welcoming to them.\"\nShaver-Moskowitz said the Imagineers spent time looking at children's museums and water play spaces to see how kids engage and developed different stations throughout the land to cater to different types of play patterns.\n\"We know a day at Disneyland can be hectic and chaotic, running from one attraction to another, one reservation to the next,\" he said. \"We wanted Toontown to not only be exciting, but also decompressing and relaxing and welcoming.\"\nWith that in mind, the Imagineers have introduced more green spaces within the land, places to have picnics, sit and unwind, or play freely.\n\"We really wanted to take a look at Toontown, knowing how important it was for so many of our guests for many generations growing up and the so many memories here that are connected to the land, and make sure we don't lose any of that,\" Shaver-Moskowitz said. \"But, bring a lot of new magic.\"\nWhen guests enter the new Toontown, they will pass through Centoonial Park. The area is anchored by a large fountain, featuring Mickey and Minnie, as well as water tables for kids to dip their hands into, and the \"dreaming tree.\"\nThe live tree was selected from the Disney property for its cartoonish limbs and leaves. Around the trunk are sculpted roots that kids can climb over, crawl under and weave through.\n\"One of the main play functions for little ones is learning the concepts of over, under and through,\" Shaver-Moskowitz explained during a media tour of the land earlier this month. \"So you'll see some of the roots are big enough for little ones to crawl under, some of them can be used as balanced beams for little ones who are learning to get their feet underneath them.\"\n(There is a wheelchair accessible path that navigates through the roots, too.)\nCentoonial Park is also situated next to the El Capitoon Theatre, home of Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway ride. Riders are invited to the premiere of Mickey and Minnie's latest cartoon short \"Perfect Picnic.\" However, hijinks ensue and guests are whisked away for a ride on Goofy's train, entering the cartoon world.\nThe trackless ride has no restrictions on height or age, allowing even the littlest Disney guest to join in.\nContinuing through the land, guests will see Goofy's new play yard, which wraps around Goofy's house and features a sound garden, filled with musical bridges and melons, as well as Fort Max, a climbable clubhouse with attached slides.\nShaver-Moskowitz said the roller slides were chosen for the space so littler guests, who often have less mobility in their legs, don't get stuck at the bottom of the slide. There's also more space at the bottom of the slides to accommodate guests who need time to get back into wheelchairs.\n\"We are trying to make sure we're thinking of every single guest in here,\" he said. \"Making sure that every little one who comes to play here feels like we've designed the space for them.\"\nAlso outside is a small cordoned-off area for babies to crawl around and experience the area safely.\nInside Goofy's house are a series of games that kids can play to help Goofy cultivate honey from the beehives on his property into candy. Here, little parkgoers can sort candy by flavor and color and watch as a kinetic ball machine activates all around the space.\nExtra care was taken to ensure that the sound of the air compressors pushing the balls around has been suppressed, said Shaver-Moskowitz, in an effort to make sure that those with sensory sensitivity won't be overwhelmed and can still enjoy the experience with their peers.\nIn a separate area next to Goofy's new play yard is Donald's Duck Pond, a water experience for kids. Imagineers intentionally separated this space from the play yard so that parents could better monitor their children around the water elements.\nShaver-Moskowitz noted that the previous design of the land meant that kids would occasionally run back to their parents soaking wet, having wandered into the water play place.\nDonald's Duck Pond features a tug boat that spits out water, spinning water lilies, balance beams and rocking toys. Inside the boat, kids can help Huey, Dewey, Louie and Webby with a leak in the hull, turning wheels and levers to push the water outside.\nThe Imagineers have also revamped the food at Toontown. New restaurants such as Cafe Daisy and Good Boy! Grocers offer a wide variety of selections and flavors for young parkgoers and more mature palates.\nMichele Gendreau, director of product optimization for food and beverage, explained that the team wanted to make eating easy by creating hand-held food that can be munched on the go.\nThe menu at Daisy's café features \"flop over\" pizzas, hot dogs and wraps. Here, adults can grab a cold brew coffee or honey-mango sweet tea. For dessert, there are mini doughnuts covered in cinnamon sugar.\n\"Kids want to eat what their parents eat,\" said Gendreau, highlighting kid-friendly versions of traditional pizzas.\nAt Good Boy! Grocers, guests can pick up grab-and-go drinks, snacks and novelties. The roadside stand offers up the \"perfect picnic basket,\" including up to three snacks and a drink. Kids can choose from a variety of options, from hummus and pickles to granola bars and apple slices.\nBaskets are set up at multiple heights to allow even the smallest guests to select their own items, giving them a little autonomy when it comes to meal time.\nParkgoers can scoop up picnic blankets, T-shirts, toys and other exclusive Toontown merchandise at EngineEar Souvenirs.\nAdditionally, meet-and-greets with fan favorite characters return to the land. Guests can take photos with Mickey Mouse, Minnie, Donald Duck, Daisy, Pluto, Clarabelle and Goofy.

At the end of its fiscal fourth-quarter, inventories stood at $1.6 billion, about 30% higher than the year ago period, although down slightly from the fiscal third quarter.\nAs part of its new strategy under Dillon, Foot Locker is revisiting its store footprint in a bid to drive revenue and acquire new customers. While it plans to close about 400 underperforming mall stores in North America, it plans to bolster its new format stores from about 120 to more than 400 by 2026.\nThe new formats include Foot Locker's community stores, power stores and its house of play concept."},

And it happens to be a terribly oversimplified one. A more nuanced framework that deserves much more attention than it receives: \"Stop bad, support good.\"\nFor a long time now, Gary Gensler's SEC has been the (de facto, not de jure) most prominent and outspoken regulator of cryptocurrencies.\nThe agency nearly doubled the size of its crypto assets enforcement unit\n. It demanded over a million dollars from Kim Kardashian for her role in pumping crypto\n(big score for everyone who had the foresight to put \"SEC publishes a press release with Kim K's name in the headline\" on their 2022 bingo card). It cracked down on Kraken's staking program with a big fat (for Kraken) $30 million fine\n.\nThe fanbase cheering on these moves isn't exactly huge.\nEven from within, other commissioners—like Hester Peirce—have publicly criticized the agency's approach. Its tug-of-war with other agencies, including but not limited to the CFTC, continues despite President Biden's call for harmony in his executive order on crypto last March. And, of course, industry executives are happy to offer their two (non-interest bearing, of course) cents.\nMany in the crypto industry want this \"regulation by enforcement\" to stop. But as\nand\nboth suggested earlier this year, there's probably no end in sight.\nWhy? Because this is what the SEC does best. Enforcement is in its DNA.\nThe SEC is a weed killer. We can't get mad at a weed killer for not growing fruit. At best, we can argue about what does or doesn't constitute a weed, and whether or not the thing that just got sprayed should've been.\nThe approach the U.S. federal government has taken to regulating this industry is a bit like spray coating your entire garden with Weed B Gon (not an endorsement) and then, waiting for the harvest.\nThis is exactly why \"Too little, too much, just right\" isn't sufficient. But \"Stop bad, support good\" helps us realize that we are missing half the puzzle.\nWell-crafted government policy doesn't just stop bad actors. It also promotes progress and prosperity. It's as much of a trellis for good plants as it is a weed killer. That's what we've lost sight of.\nThat's why it can't be just the SEC. We need a more holistic approach at the federal level.\nThat's why we need to advocate for public-private partnerships like\nto back blockchain and Web3 startups or the older\nlaunched in collaboration with Giga to make investments with crypto in early-stage tech startups.\nThat's why we need to raise awareness about big grants supporting research and education at the university level like\n, the\nmade possible by a donation from IOHK at the University of Wyoming or\n.\nAnd that's why we need government officials to balance the narrative, helping the American public to see that it's about keeping the baby as much as it is about throwing out the bathwater—whether that's making financial services inclusive and more frictionless, financing new and exciting applications of blockchain tech or simply supporting the spirit of American innovation."},

Its earnings from the operations also have fallen by nearly 70% since peaking in 2014.\nThe coronavirus pandemic, which originated in China, is partially to blame. However, the declines started years before the global health crisis and are growing increasingly more complex amid rising economic and political tensions between the U.S. and China.\nThere's also growing competition from government-backed domestic automakers fueled by nationalism and a generational shift in consumer perceptions regarding the automotive industry and electric vehicles.\nTake, for example, Will Sundin, a 34-year-old science teacher who told CNBC he never envisioned buying a Chinese-branded vehicle when he moved to the\ncountry in 2011.\nMore recently Sundin purchased a Nio ET7 electric vehicle as his daily driver in Changsha, the capital city of China's Hunan Province.\n\"I wanted something big and comfortable, but I also wanted something that was a bit quick,\" he said. \"I like the look of it.\"\nSundin, who moonlights as\n, knows the Chinese vehicle industry well.

He said the vehicle's ability to swap out the battery for a fresh one, rather than recharging, \"put it ahead pretty quickly.\"\nNot on his consideration list? American brands such as GM's Cadillac and Buick, which initially led the automaker's growth in China.\n\"Cadillac has a good image in China, but it's expensive,\" said Sundin, who previously owned a 2012 Ford Focus. \"I think the problem they face is that they have competition, new competition, a lot of new competition, from different directions that they weren't expecting.\"\nThat competition is increasingly becoming a problem for GM, which has acknowledged such issues with its Chinese business. However, the company has not offered much assurance on how to reverse the trend other than the promise of new EVs and a new business\nthat will import pricy vehicles with high margins from the U.S. to China.\nWhile many U.S. brands aren't performing well in China, GM's decline is especially notable. GM's operations in the country are much larger than those of its crosstown rival\nfor example. It also has a much smaller footprint globally after shedding its European operations and shuttering operations elsewhere to largely focus on North America, China and, to a lesser extent, South America.\nBeing overly reliant on only a few markets can be risky. But it has led to\n, as the company under CEO Mary Barra has done away with underperforming operations. Electric vehicles could be a new opportunity for GM to grow globally, but experts say it would be an uphill battle compared with recovering in China in the years to come.\n\"With the changes that they put in place, with a refocus on North America and China, the pull out of Europe, essentially, that does create a risky scenario now that you have some issues, multiple issues, going on in the Chinese market,\" said Jeff Schuster, executive vice president of LMC Automotive, a GlobalData company.\nGM has been downplaying the role of its operations in China in recent quarters, including CFO Paul Jacobson saying China is \"not decisive\" to GM's financial performance when he discussed\nBarra said in December that China is an important part of GM's business but that the company also is paying attention to other issues, which then included the government's now-defunct \"zero Covid\" policy and recent protests.\n\"We still see opportunity there ... obviously, we also watch the geopolitical situation. We can't operate in a vacuum,\" she said during an Automotive Press Association meeting. \"But we continue to see opportunity there and we'll continue to evaluate the situation, but our plans are to be in a leadership position in EVs.\"\nA bright spot for GM in China has been its Wuling Hongguang Mini, made by a joint venture, which is the bestselling EV in the market. Since going on sale in mid-2020, the economy car has sold more than 1 million units.\nStill, Jacobson earlier this year said China's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and surging Covid cases accounted for the nearly 40% drop in equity income for the operations in 2022.\nGM reports its earnings from China as equity income because the country mandates joint ventures for non-Chinese automakers — other than Tesla, which was\n. GM has 10 joint ventures, two wholly owned foreign enterprises and more than 58,000 employees in China. Its brands include Cadillac, Buick, Chevrolet, Wuling and Baojun.\n\"We see a lot of Covid cases in China right now that slowed down the consumer. So we expect it'll be a little bit of a slow buildup but hopefully, working its way back up to levels that we're used to over time,\" he told reporters on\nBut it's not just related to the pandemic. Equity income from GM's Chinese operations and joint ventures has fallen 67% since its peak of more than $2 billion in 2014 and 2015. That includes a decline of about 45% from then to 2019 — prior to the coronavirus crippling China's economy and vehicle production. In 2022, GM's Chinese operations garnered equity income of $677 million for GM.\n\"This is not Covid. This started well before Covid,\" Michael Dunne, CEO of\n, a consulting firm focused on China, electrification and autonomous vehicles. \"It also coincides with escalating tensions between the United States and China. There's no question, and it's impossible to measure, but it's definitely a factor.\"\nDunne, president of GM's Indonesia operations from 2013-15, said the decline of GM and other nondomestic automakers comes alongside China's market growth slowing, Chinese automakers becoming increasingly more competitive and the shift to all-electric vehicles — which has been massively subsidized by government agencies.\n\"They've all really taken it on the chin in the last five years as middle market brands. The Chinese consumers are increasingly buying Chinese brands,\" he said. \"That's a seismic shift ... the mindset has changed.\"\nDomestic startups and automakers have helped Beijing realize its goal of boosting penetration of new energy vehicles — a category that includes electric cars. More than one-fourth of passenger cars sold in China last year were new energy vehicles, according to the China Passenger Car Association, which predicts penetration will reach 36% this year.\nLocal companies rushed to grab a slice of that growth in an auto market that was slumping overall.
